<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-RULES</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-A game for four players.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Played with two standard 52 card decks and the addition of the four joker cards. There should be two big jokers and two small jokers (or otherwise two pairs of distinguishable jokers). Bicycle cards work well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-The game is played in teams of two with players arranged in a circle such that teammates are across from each other.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-The objective of the game is to take 1000 points as a team over a series of rounds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-To begin a round, shuffle the 108 cards and deal 27 to each player.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-In the first round, the player possessing both two of clubs leads the first trick. If two players each have a single two of clubs, then between them whoever has the two two of diamonds leads the first trick. If problems persist, continue with the two of spades, then the two of hearts, then the three of clubs, and so on.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-In subsequent rounds, the player that finishes first (see below) on the previous round leads the first trick.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-A round consists of a number of tricks. The player leading a trick may play any valid hand (see below). Play then proceeds clockwise. A player may play a larger hand of the same type, a bomb (see below), or pass. If there a bomb is played then subsequent plays must be higher bombs.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Once all three other players have passed, the last player to play on the trick takes the trick and leads the next trick.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-A round ends when one of two conditions have been met. Either three players have run out of cards or one team has run out of cards (denoted as finishing first and second).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-If a team finishes first and second then that team receives 200 points and the other team receives 0.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Otherwise, the following occurs. The player that finished first takes all of the tricks that their partner took (but not any remaining cards, if any). Then the player that still has cards (denoted finished last) gives any tricks they took and their hand to the other team.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Next, points are assigned to a team as follows. For every five taken, a team receives 5 points. For every ten and king taken, that team receives 10 points. Thus there are 200 points available every round.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Additionally, there are two special scoring rules.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-At the beginning of a round (after players view their cards), each player decides whether or not they want to declare starting with the player leading the first trick and proceeding clockwise. If a player declares then if they finish first their team receives an extra 100 points. If they do not then their team losses 100 points.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Similarly, each player has the option of blind declaring. This occurs identically to a regular declare with the exception that it must be made before players view their cards. This version is worth 200 points on success and -200 points on failure.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-The first team to 1000 points (or if both reach 1000 points on the same round then the team with the highest score) wins.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-VALID HANDS</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-First, note the following. Card value in ascending order is 3-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, 2, Small Joker, Big Joker. Additionally, aces are not consecutive with 2s, 2s are not consecutive with small jokers, and small jokers are not consecutive with big jokers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Next note that the following are all bombs. N-of-a-kind where N is at least 4. N-straight-flush where N is at least 5.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-The following are all valid hands. Note that for a hand which has an N in it to be the same type, the value of N must be the same for both hands. Also, except when playing a single card, big and small jokers are indistinguishable (eg a pair of big jokers is not a higher hoof than two small jokers).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-A single card. A card is larger than another card if it has a higher value.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-N consecutive pairs where N is at least 1. (eg two threes, plus two fours, plus two fives is 3 consecutive pairs). An N consecutive pair is higher than another if the highest pair has a higher value than the other N consecutive pair’s highest pair.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-N consecutive triples where N is at least 1. An N consecutive triple is higher than another if the highest triple has a higher value than the other N consecutive triple’s highest triple.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-An N straight where N is at least 5. An N straight is higher than another N straight if the highest value of the straight is greater than the other straight’s highest value.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-N consecutive full houses where N is at least 1. Note that only the triples must be consecutive (eg two threes and two queens with three fives and three sixes is consecutive). An N consecutive full house is higher than another N consecutive full house if the highest triple has a higher value than the other’s highest triple.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-A bomb. An N-of-a-kind is higher than another N-of-a-kind if it consists of higher valued cards. An N straight flush is higher than another in the same manner as an ordinary straight. An N straight flush is higher than any M-of-a-kind where M is at most N. An N-of-a-kind is higher than any M straight flush where M is less than N. (eg a royal flush beats any 4- or 5-of-a-kind but a 6-, 7-, or 8-of-a-kind beats it).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">-Note that four jokers are considered as the highest 6-of-a-kind.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">The world shook.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was midday when Twilight appeared south of the most dangerous natural wonder in Equestria, if not the entire world. The twisted chaotic magic that surged through the Everfree Forest scorched Twilight’s horn even from where she stood nearly a kilometer away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The enchantments she always cast on herself began malfunctioning forcing Twilight to dispel them before any serious harm befell her. With no further spells, for she had dismissed her bag of holding before leaving, under her control, the wrath of the forest receded. It did not vanish, but stood watching for the slightest hint of magic to once more lash out against.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This was the reason the Everfree Forest was feared by nearly every single being on Equus. Magic could be used within it with great difficulty, but there was no telling what the forest would morph the magic into. It was just as likely for a fireball spell to summon a glass of water as it was to turn the caster into a penguin or simply blow up in the caster’s face.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pegasii could not fly, or even stand on a cloud near the Everfree. Earth ponies had it worst, being unable to turn off their magic. If one wandered too close to the forest, it would tear them apart until their magic had been shredded away resulting in death. Few non-pony species fared any better.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The Elements of Harmony would create order and peace in a small area, but they remained locked down in the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters by Celestia with every ward against transportation she knew. There were no quick ways in or out of the castle, consequently requiring any visitors to walk.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Thus, it was with great trepidation, that Twilight Sparkle, the archmage who lived and breathed magic, ventured into the Everfree. Twilight would have turned around, teleported back to Canterlot, and told Celestia to pick up the elements herself, whether she could actually touch them in any way or not, if it hadn’t been for the princess’s promise.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia claimed the old road leading to the old castle still kept the unsavory creatures of the forest at bay. And when Twilight arrived, despite being subjected to the chaos of the forest for nearly a millennium, she found that the path did still exist.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Taking her first step onto the broken brick road being invaded by the gentler greenery of the forest, Twilight felt a sense of calm surround her. The sensation of a cruel and unforgiving forest still surrounded her, but on the path at least, it was subdued.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ever the experimentalist, Twilight couldn’t help herself attempting some simple telekinesis.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The agony of the forest eating away at her magic was unbearable. If she had been in any fit state to think, she would have been desperately hoping her screams and thrashing hadn’t awakened anything.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Whimpering and crying, Twilight laid on the ground, desperately trying to comfort the intangible part of herself she called her magic as the forest retreated, clearly pleased with the meal.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Several minutes later, but with no regrets, Twilight arose. Preventing herself from reflexively wiping the tears away with telekinesis, Twilight used her forehoof instead and continued down the path.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Aside from the poor start, the journey was relatively peaceful. The road was in terrible disrepair making it difficult for Twilight to keep her balance, and every loose stone she kicked sent her into a panic, but it was still a road. It therefore offered an expeditious trip to the old castle lying at its end. Even the stone arch bridge at the end had weathered the test of time well enough to be utilized.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ascending the hill just after the bridge, the ruined castle came into Twilight’s view. It remained a magnificent structure in the way all old castles were even with more than half of its towers collapsed in on itself. The forest was beginning to reclaim the stone as giant ferns and trees grew in between cracks in the masonry.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A massive doorway, long since deprived of a door stood out among the many windows missing their panes. The interior of the castle appeared to be in the same state it presented from outside, though a few tapestries had managed to survive unlike their wooden cousins, the doors.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Stopping just inside the area influence by the elements, Twilight sat down to rest after walking nearly for nearly four hours on the uneven cobblestone road. She wasn’t out of shape by any means, but neither was she a star athlete without her enchantments.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It wasn’t long before Twilight again tried working simple magic. Unlike before, the forest did not lash out at her, though she could feel it menacing her beyond the reach of the elements. Satisfied with the initial success, Twilight worked her way up to more complex spells, eventually curing herself of the exhaustion she felt.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Satisfied, Twilight stood up and began the worst part of the journey. The forest itself was dangerous, but being eaten was the worst thing that could happen there. The forest was cruel and dangerous, but it did not have intent.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The old castle was also cruel and dangerous, but unlike the forest, it was explicitly designed by Celestia to be so to keep anypony foolish enough to reach it away. The outer wards were simple, warning spells. Essentially practical jokes by the standards of the spells in the heart of the castle despite involving fire, acid, and all manner of other horrible things.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had been given <span style=" font-style:italic;">very</span> specific instructions on how to enter the castle, and she was following them exactly. She still had no spells active except a single one that radiated a friendly signal.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But that was not enough, entry required specific gestures and movements to be performed at specific points. A series of passwords were required to be spoken every five steps and although there were many paths to the throne room, each required a different sequence. Twilight nearly cursed her friend for putting a song on every path, but didn’t since the wards would probably strike her down the moment she did.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even having satisfied the wards in every way, they still felt hostile to Twilight. It wasn’t the same primal of the forest, but a calculated feeling trying to decide whether or not to destroy her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Glad she came alone, Twilight finished the song and the subsequent dance and reached the entrance to the throne room. Of all the rooms she had passed on the way, the throne room was by far the most intact. Fallen bricks littered the floor, but the windows were only broken, the doors remained, and the giant boulders so common in the rest of the castle were absent.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At the far side of the hall stood two alicorn sized thrones, one with a sun motif and the other sporting a similar design incorporating the moon. In front of the thrones in the center of the chamber stood a large pedestal, clearly not part of the original design, with five outcroppings.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">On each outcropping was a hoof-sized, gray spheres and the pedestal itself held a larger stone sphere. Clearly these were the unawakened Elements of Harmony. The one in the middle seemed particularly tantalizing. Twilight figured it was probably the Element of Magic calling to her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This was the were Celestia had laid the worst traps that would kill a pony before a single spell could be cast. Passing them only required knowledge of a name long lost to the ages with the exception of Celestia and Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dear sister, Luna Ezell Satilus, please forgive me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The words spoken, the wards finally enveloped Twilight and accepted her as a friend. Twilight immediately recast several of her more useful enchantments including her bag of holding where she intended to store the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sigh… That password… Now that I think about it, Celestia’s had a thousand years of guilt building up in her. It’s impressive that Equestria’s running so well, but she has to snap at some point. I really hope that point isn’t when her sister returns.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight approached the pedestal and floated herself up to the first element which was out of the reach of an ordinary unicorn. Upon closer inspection, the sphere was hollow and had a few glass-like openings that allowed her to a small necklace inside, although she could not get a good look at it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Noticing that the outcropping the element had laid on was labeled Laughter, Twilight summoned some paper and labeled the element itself before stuffing it away in her bag of holding. Going from element to element, she did the same for each one.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Hmm… Each one contains a golden necklace. Very light too. I’d love to know how the necklaces are suspended in the center. Oh, hello there, Generosity. Thanks for the better view.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight facehoofed. <span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, now Celestia has me ponyifying you too. Whatever. What do you have to show me?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">One of Twilight’s many assorted light spells flared from her horn as she tried to get a fuller view of Generosity’s interior.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Some kind of dull, gray gem on the necklace. I have no idea what it is…but it’s not shiny so nopony cares, right? Yeah. I suppose that makes some sense. Celestia did say the element reflects the bearer’s cutie mark, and it’s still ‘sleeping’ so it needs to imprint on somepony.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Now, that’s all the other elements. All that’s left is Ma—</span> “Argh!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Twilight touch Magic, a blinding light like a star descended to Equus spilled forth from it. When it faded, Twilight let her hoof fall back down and saw that where the sphere had been rested a tiara with six-pointed star shaped gems inlaid in it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Huh.</span> Twilight thought, staring idly at Magic.<span style=" font-style:italic;"> Unexpected. I get that Magic is sort of like the boss element, but why should it be different? Argh! This is going to be an itch I can’t scratch for a month. Maybe forever. No, Celestia has no idea how these things work but that doesn’t make them unknowable.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Bah, so be it. Also, Note to Self: Do not test for elemental bearerness in public or anywhere with windows without wards.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight levitated Magic onto her head. Immediately, she felt its effects flow through her, expanding her magical power enormously.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Wow! This is…simply amazing. A rough guess would say Magic’s increasing my magic by an order of magnitude. I wonder what else it— No, Twilight. You have an insane goddess coming. Just ask Celestia for details and experiment later.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With the wards now accepting her as a friend, but still blocking teleportation and other fast travel, Twilight walked out of the castle without a care. Magic still rested on her brow and ordered the chaos of the forest around her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soon she had walked far enough to remove the castle from the protection of the elements and behind her she could hear the whine and crackle of the forest tearing apart Celestia’s wards. Within a minute, the sounds died down and Twilight couldn’t detect any trace of the once dangerous spells.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With the elements stabilizing the forest’s magic, Twilight decided it was time to experiment yet again. She assumed it would be safe to simply teleport out, but at the same time it would be very embarrassing to die <span style=" font-style:italic;">after</span> retrieving the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight fired off the same series of spells she had earlier and was far from surprised to discover her magic was functioning normally. Satisfied that it would be safe to try, she teleported a nearby brick.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">First she teleported it to just inside the range of Magic’s effects and then she teleported it far outside. Both times the brick arrived in normal condition. However, when she attempted to teleport it back, the brick turned into sawdust.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Alright then. Teleporting is fine so long as I don’t teleport anything outside of Magic’s range.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s horn glowed brightly, a pale imitation of the shining Magic had recently delivered, meaning to make the journey out of the forest in a single jump. With Magic helping, she felt she could make the trip back to Canterlot in a single jump and decided to to just that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The light her horn gave off grew and grew as Twilight built up more and more power, culminating in a dazzle rivaling all but Celestia’s most powerful spells.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Okay, Magic, let’s get out of this infernal forest.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy sat next to Princess Celestia at a table overloaded with paperwork. At first, she had been giddy just being in the same room, but as the day wore on the thrill began to taper off rapidly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Was Princess Celestia intelligent? Of course. Did she have hundreds of lifetimes of experience dwarfing Daisy’s own? Absolutely. Would a poet describe her as beautiful? Obviously. Had she the grace and sophistication expected of a ruler? Not so much.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In public, there was no doubt that the princess showed all the manners of Canterlot high society, but when it was just the two of them, her behavior radically changed. She still had a formal tone, but she complained, chatted, and gossiped just like a regular pony while they plowed through document after document.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was clear Princess Celestia had not been lying when she said she wanted to get to know Daisy. In return, Daisy had learned quite a lot of private and <span style=" font-style:italic;">very</span> embarrassing things about Twilight and the princess that, unsurprisingly, never became public knowledge.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“—and then she said ‘now that everypony with trivial problems has left, call the first petitioner.’”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pff— Di— Did she really?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“According to Lined Weld, she said it with a heartwarming smile. Can you believe that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy fell apart laughing and knocked a stack of papers off the table. Celestia managed to catch them before the scattered, but Daisy would still have to go through them to reorder them a bit.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Heh heh. Wow. Just, wow. I can see why you don’t let Twilight hold court anymore.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, that is not the whole story. She had been to court once before, but it ended in similar disaster. I would not have even asked if my business elsewhere had not been urgent. She is not exactly banned from appearing at court. She just dislikes being there and I have excused her from the duty.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Gazing at her own work laid before her, Daisy said, “It’s not like she doesn’t do enough already. She drilled that speed reading spell into my head last night after Spike went to bed and I still can’t keep up with all this.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am very lucky to have her. I offered her the position, fully expecting her to run off to some mountain and build a fortress of solitude to further her research alone. Obviously enough, that did not happen and, for all her faults, Equestria has never run smoother since.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia’s tone shifted, although Daisy wasn’t sure if she was joking or serious when she continued, “Still, sometimes I think about firing her. She has made it no secret that she hates the job. I am certain she only stays for my sake. You would not happen to want a full time position, would you? It comes with <span style=" font-style:italic;">every</span> perk.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My apologizes, Princess Celestia, but not a chance. I don’t want to die in five years from overwork.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Such a shame, you—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Whatever Princess Celestia was about to say was cut off by a massive thunderclap from above. A moment later, looking outside the window, Daisy could see thousands, if not millions of red and violet sparkles shimmering in the afternoon sky, slowly drifting downward.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once the ringing stopped — the princess was responsible for the timely cure — Daisy asked, “What was that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“One moment, I have to go keep the guard from launching a full assault.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia disappeared into light and reappeared half a minute later.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, that was Twilight,” the princess finally answered. “What you just witnessed is a more primitive version of her teleports. The sparkles are her teleport signature and the noise was a typical defect of teleportation, although much louder than usual.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But there was never any hint of either of that when she carried Astral and I here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, but from the laughter I suspect she made the jump here all the way from the south side of the Everfree Forest.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy was too impressed to ask how Twilight pulled together to power necessary to complete such a feat and instead asked a much more mundane question she could more easily comprehend. “What laughter?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia’s horn shone for a brief moment and then the sounds of the world suddenly became much sharper to Daisy. She could hear the guards posted outside shifting nervously but not leaving their posts. The nearby maids’s hoofsteps came to her as if they were in the same room. A conversation between two nobles was now on the edges of her hearing though she couldn’t make out the words.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And indeed, in the sky above came the sound of Twilight locked in maniacal laughter.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is she okay? She seems a bit…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, she does this every time she discovers something truly interesting.” Looking out the window, the princess snickered. “If you look closely, you can still see her rolling around on a small cloud. Although, we need to go speak with her anyway, so we might as well get a closer view. Do you have your cloud-walking bracelet?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy shook her head and she felt the now familiar yank of a teleport whisking her away to reappear standing on the same cloud as Twilight who was indeed rolling around and laughing uncontrollably. She now wore a golden tiara that somehow managed to remain on her head throughout the ordeal it was put through.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia lifted Twilight revelry and set her on her hooves. “I think you have had entirely enough of that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Reduced to a giggle, Twilight struggled to regain her breath until her horn stopped glowing. “I disagree. Laughter is good for a pony, and there’s none better than the maniacal variety.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Just take us to your room so we can talk privately.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Spoilsport,” Twilight said as her horn glowed. Another teleportation yank relocated Daisy, Twilight and Princess Celestia into Twilight’s tower.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Before Daisy regained her sense of balance, the princess had already taken a seat and Twilight was busy stuffing things back into her bag of holding.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Celestia, but I need to learn how to create sub-dimensional storage.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still a bit dazed, Daisy half-fell, half-sat on the closest sofa. As she recovered, she felt her gaze be drawn back to the tiara Twilight wore. It felt inviting somehow, but at the same time like a friend that had just gotten a coltfriend and had no interest in spending time with her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight walked over to Princess Celestia, a stack of papers in her magic, and Daisy followed her every step.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Here’s your layout for trapping the old castle back. I’ve made a number of improvements so you can stuff more spells in without destabilizing the area. I also would really like to know how the enchantments on the Everfree road are still there, especially after witnessing the forest destroy all of the ones in the castle, but that can wait.” Twilight eyed the clock hanging from the wall. “It took longer to walk to the castle than I had hoped.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia quickly reviewed the papers she had been hoofed. “This is very impressive, Twilight. I suppose this is related to what you asked me two nights ago.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dense magic has become a bit of a specialty for me, as well as striping magic down to its bare minimum.” Twilight turned away from the princess and mumbled, “It’s never enough though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy would not have normally heard that, but thanks to the spell Princess Celestia had placed on her it came through clear enough. But, despite its clarity, it might as well have been unheard because Daisy’s attention was still fixed on the tiara.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Daisy?” Surprised by hearing her own name, Daisy jumped and broke her gaze at the tiara. She looked from Twilight to Princess Celestia trying to figure out who had called to her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s wrong?” Twilight asked. It must have been her. “You seem rather out of it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nothing. I just— What is that tiara you’re wearing?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight raised an eyebrow and asked, “Does it seem fascinating in one way or another?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was perhaps the most fascinating object Daisy had ever seen. Immediately, Twilight facehoofed as she agreed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Celestia?” The accusation in Twilight’s voice was almost palpable.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, no, no, no, no. <span style=" font-style:italic;">This</span> is not my fault. There is no reason you can not expect me to have known there was a diamond in the rough hanging around that we could find in one, or six, months.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Besides, Magic is yours now. It can not take on a new partner until you die or betray it, neither of which are acceptable options. There is nothing we can do.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sigh…” said Twilight dramatically. “The tiara is Magic — capital m — and it’s part of a set of artifacts known as the Elements of Harmony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Am I allowed to know about this?” asked Daisy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, sure. You could find out more in old foals’s books so there’s hardly any harm in telling you directly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyway, there’s six elements and I’m leaving to find bearers for the other five since they are kind of picky about who they’ll work with. Used together, the elements can produce a number of interesting effects. Among those effects is what a pony could crudely describe as instant therapy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s why we need them right now. Celestia’s super powered lunatic sister is coming back from banishment and we’d like to not be frozen to death in eternal night.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…I see…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good. If you want details ask Celestia later or visit the archives. Naturally, you shouldn’t tell anypony about this. We’re working to make whatever happens go as smoothly as possible which would be not at all if the public found out about the Nightmare Moon version of Luna.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nightmare Moon? You mean, like the one from Nightmare Night?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s more of a cultural derivative, but yes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh,” Daisy said, her emotionless voice matching her inner state perfectly. She was surprised to find she was taking news of an upcoming potential apocalypse rather well. It could be because her thoughts kept being drawn back to the tiara.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So what did you mean when you said I was a diamond in the rough?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Basically you could have borne Magic yourself,” Princess Celestia answered. “It is a moot point now, but it would have been convenient. The Elements of Harmony are powered by friendship between the bearers and Twilight is not particularly good at making friends.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight interrupted, “I believe your exact words were I am the worst pick and I have no social skills.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…That sounds right. So you see, Daisy, having an open and trustworthy bearer for Magic would have been incredibly helpful. But again, it is a moot point now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy let herself absorb the information. She was not disappointed, not exactly anyway. She had no interest in fighting goddesses or anypony else. But knowing that the attraction she felt towards Magic would never be satisfied was annoying.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Attraction? Did I mean that?</span> Daisy searched her feelings but could not deny them. <span style=" font-style:italic;">I think I’m crushing on a tiara… That’s so weird.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Distracting herself with a question she really should have been asking with more urgency, Daisy inquired, “Do you think things will work out?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even with hundreds of years of experience with lying through her teeth, Princess Celestia could not make a normal face and settled for what was presumably the truth. “…We have other plans in place. The worst case scenarios should be prevented. On the topic, Twilight, bring out the other elements and see if any of them bond with Daisy. A jump start on the main plan would be far more helpful than a paperwork companion.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Five stone spheres appeared in the air from nowhere and Daisy once more reminded herself to learn sub-dimensional storage magic. She examined each in turn, but none of the other elements held the same fascination that Magic had.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia told her to try touching them anyway, just in case, but there was no response from any of the inert lumps.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose I could not expect anything else,” Princess Celestia said. “I did not really want to do all that work myself anyway. I shall just consider this a blessing in disguise.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“From who?” interjected Twilight. “Nightmare Moon?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The princess pretended to laugh at Twilight’s joke and pulled out a few papers, again from nowhere with more jealousy from Daisy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you are quite done here, then take this and go about your business. You said you were running late.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight took the papers and sent them back into nowhere. “These are the elements’s documentation, correct?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, everything I knew about them is written down. It is not much, but it is all I have.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, then,” said Twilight, her horn glowing. “I’ll see you…later.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight,”  Princess Celestia said like a parent to a foal that has forgotten something important.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her horn dimmed and Twilight said, “What is it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Magic. We need you to leave that with us, remember?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, yeah.” Twilight removed Magic from her head and held it out halfway to Daisy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re giving it to me?” asked Daisy, her emotions a mix of both desired and caution. She was uncertain how she would feel when it came time to return the tiara.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, that’s another reason why I wanted to get a substitute for me. Celestia can’t even touch the elements because she’s a terrible pony. Completely unharmonious. I think she’s even married to Discord who’s like the exact opposite of harmony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy looked uncertainly at Princess Celestia who rolled her eyes.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do not take a word of that seriously. Except for the first part. I lost my own connection to half of the elements when I used them all to banish my sister. Part of the plan calls for spell casting in the old castle and surrounding areas and I need a mobile element for that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That train of logic had an obvious flaw. “Couldn’t you just put it in a wagon and pull it around?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I tried a lot of things like that before.” Princess Celestia seemed lost in though and started laughing. “Now that I really think about it, from the outside I must have looked ridiculous.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“To answer your question, no. The elements are very stubborn and would not even budge. I even constructed a Rube Goldberg machine, although there was no such name at the time, and nothing happened. That is a story for another time though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll just pretend that makes sense.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“At times like this,” Twilight began, “it’s usually best to just say ‘a wizard did it’ and move on.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right…” Daisy wrapped her own magic around Magic floating in front of her and pulled but Twilight did not let go and was much stronger. “Um… You can let go, Twilight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course…” Twilight said biting her lip but managing to withdraw her magic in a few moments. “Letting go of an element is harder than I thought.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Turning to Princess Celestia, Twilight said, “I completely understand what you were trying to say before. Do you feel like this all the time?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fortunately not. I remember the longing and the sensations, but the elements and Magic in particular are more objects of revulsion when I am in their presence. It is…difficult to both love them and be disgusted at their very sight, but I am coping.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight looked worried, but built up the magic for a teleport. “Alright. Goodbye then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy and Princess Celestia were left alone in the tower with Magic still suspended in the air. Daisy looked at it for a little longer and finally put it on her head. The rush of power she felt was breathtaking, but not overwhelming. She certainly was not going to descend into crazed laughter anytime soon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…She left without removing you from her wards,” Princess Celestia said while staring at the spot Twilight had just before stood in. “Oh well. We shall simply have to walk down the stairs.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The princess walked over toward the door as Daisy continued to contemplate both Magic and the magical surge it gave her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Daisy, come along. We need to put Magic in storage for both of our sakes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shaking herself free of her fixation on the element, Daisy walked to join the princess.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight appeared outside Shining and Cadance’s house. The building was small, but as the insistence of Cadance’s parents it was perhaps the finest and most elegant small house in Canterlot.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It even managed to out style most of the surrounding mansions with the magnificent gardening Cadance employed in all of the empty space that would have otherwise been taken up by building.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If the two did not have to satisfy Shining’s in-laws then they would have lived much further from the castle and out of the influence of the nobility. After all, distance was no issue for Shining who was a very capable teleporter while Cadance had to walk or fly into town to meet with her publisher.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Despite some minor difficulties, Twilight though it was a nice place and she would not mind staying there if circumstances ever forced her, even if it did not have a moat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of course, moats were completely pointless. That point had been proven many times in history and had an exclamation mark added to the end by the legendary Commander Hurricane. Twilight just thought they looked nice and the space was going to waste anyway. However, neither her brother nor Cadance would hear of it and she suspected Celestia had some influence in it as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ignoring the disappointing lack of moat in the back of her mind, Twilight approached the front door. As she was about to knock, the door swung open and Cadance jumped on her with a hug.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twi! I didn’t expect you to visit again so soon!” Breaking the hug, Cadance continued to hold Twilight’s shoulders with her hooves. “Did you manage to finish a month long quest in half a day?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, but I did stop by to talk about that. Specifically to remind Spike how to keep a secret since I’m sure he’s already told Star Charmer everything he knows and she’s probably kindly shared it with you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Go easy on him, Twi. We already scolded him for it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight stared at Cadance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We did.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight continued her stare.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cracking, Cadance said, “A little bit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight just kept staring.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, barely at all. We were curious where you were going that you actually bothered to find a replacement.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“See, that is exactly why I didn’t tell you. You are terrible at lying and worse at keeping secrets.” As an afterthought, Twilight elaborated, “And Shining because he can’t keep secrets from you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can so keep a secret!” protested Cadance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ve known you practically my entire life. In that time there’s only been one secret you managed to keep around me and only because I was too busy to notice.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance winced at being reminded of that particularly ill planned surprise.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ve apologized for years that we didn’t tell you we were engaged. Years, Twilight. Can’t you let it go?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not so long as it as it remains effective to guilt trip you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You are <span style=" font-style:italic;">so</span> mean,” pouted Cadance. “I don’t remember raising you like that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can accept that; I have to be mean with my job.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight hear the approaching sound of little hoofsteps accompanied by claws just beyond a row of hedges. Turning to get a better look, Spike and Star Charmer appeared around the corner and stopped dead in their tracks when they saw Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The small pink and purple pegasus was the first to break away from Twilight’s admonishing glare and pulled Spike along with her as they fled back the way they came.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excuse me a moment, Cadance.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight teleported directly in front of the foals and in their haste they ran straight into her. Both recovered quickly and tried to escape in opposite directions but Twilight held brought them back with telekinesis and kept their hooves and claws glued to the ground.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both were panicking and avoiding looking directly at Twilight as they struggled against their bonds. Spike was about to blast the area with dragonfire but was prevented from opening his mouth to let it out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really, Spike? Dragonfire in a garden? Do you want to set fire to all of Canterlot?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“N—No! I just— It was her!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What!” Star Charmer cried, outraged. “You were practically begging to tell somepony!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nah uh!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes you were!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star Charmer descended into the the kind of substanceless argument only foals could keep up for more than a few rounds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Look,” said Twilight while snapping both of their mouths shut, “it doesn’t matter who is at fault. And honestly, I don’t care. I don’t have time to deal with you two right now so I’ll be leaving that up to Cadance. No, scratch that. I’ll leave a note for Shining.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight bent down to the duo’s height before continuing. “It’s really important that you do not tell <span style=" font-style:italic;">anypony</span> where I am. I would be easy enough to simply erase the information from your minds” — both gasped — “but I find that abhorrent.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“However, if I get word that you have revealed information then I will personally see to it that whoever you told is wiped clean, and perhaps do the same to you. Understood?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star Charmer nodded very quickly and very enthusiastically.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good.” Twilight’s stern face melted back into the usual smile she had for her family. Standing back up, she added, “If you keep your word, I may come back with something special for both of you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both were looking expectantly at Twilight, no doubt hoping she would reveal what her surprise was.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m not going to tell you what your surprise would be.” The filly’s and wyrmling’s expressions deflated. “Now go back to whatever you were doing. Fleeing, maybe?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">They looked away embarrassed. Spike especially had red cheeks that were very hard to spot under his purple scales. Star Charmer whispered something in Spike’s ear that Twilight was somehow unable to hear and they ran off.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Satisfied with her work with the foals, Twilight teleported back to Cadance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, hopefully that will keep those two quiet for a month.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance eyed Twilight suspiciously, “What did you do?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nothing much. A few stern words and an incentive. Also— One moment.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight summoned some ink and parchment and wrote:</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">BBBFF, Cadance told me you didn’t really scold Spike and/or Star Charmer. You should fix that. Think of it this way. One or both of them revealed classified information. If one of your soldiers did that, they’d find the fast exit out of the guard.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Placing the note in an summoned envelope and sealing it shut with magic, Twilight hoofed it over to Cadance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’d appreciate it if you gave this to Shining.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance took the letter and said, “Do you want to just come inside. Shiny will be back soon for supper. We’d both love it if you joined us.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’d love too, but I have a lot of loose ends to put together before I leave. Anyway, back to our own conversation. I expect you to do your very best to keep my location to yourself. The future of the entire world, not just Equestria, is riding on my ability to make friends. The whole archmage thing tends to be a wall with most ponies and that could take too long to get over.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Horrified, Cadance asked, “You’re trying to save the world with friendship?” Twilight nodded. “We’re doomed…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I wish I could tell you not to worry, but the situation is pretty bad. The only comfort I can give you is we can avoid the worst case scenario which is the world being destroyed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And…if anything happens to me. Spike will… He will need a new—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance embraced Twilight with hooves and wings.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, Twi. If anything ever happens to you, we will always be there for Spike.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her voice barely a whisper, Twilight said, “Thank you, Cadance. I don’t know how I can ever than you for all the help you’ve given me with Spike.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t give me that. I was the only one agreeing with your decision to adopt him. It’s natural I bear some of the responsibility.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks,” Twilight said again. Then, losing all of the gratitude and love in her voice, Twilight returned to her normal tone. “But that and this are two entirely different things. Don’t tell anypony or I’ll…” Twilight stopped to think. “Or I’ll call you Mi Amore Cadenza for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Eww!” Cadance said with the exact same tone of disgust she had once used when Shining and Twilight had pranked her with the single worst drink ponykind was capable of mixing. “Twi, I hate my title!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then don’t tell anypony. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance softly stamped her hoof to emphasize her next point. “You really are mean.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Giggling, Twilight agreed, “Yep. I blame the nobility. With a few royal exceptions.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…I can understand that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With a wave of her hoof and a flare of her horn, Twilight said, “Goodbye then. If I have time, I’ll come visit,” and was gone.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage had a sandy textured coat and a light blue mane and tail that bore a distinctly ocean feel. His cutie mark was a palm tree on a tiny island. His eyes were purple.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">They were always purple.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of the many disguises he took, he always left his eyes purple to remind himself of his lover, even in his otherwise unaltered form.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If I pretend I didn’t see her, she’ll just go away,” Espionage whispered to himself.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">He had been on Haywaii for the past three days enjoying his first ever vacation with his wife. It also happened to be his first vacation ever.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I blend in with the beach. There’s no way she can find me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">He was currently alone which made his camouflage far more effective. His lover didn’t exactly stick out against sand, but neither did she mesh well with it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please don’t be looking for me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage had seen a small purple speck on the horizon completely by chance and had watched it grow in long, rapid jumps only one pony was capable of.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The archmage appeared in one final teleport on the beach some ways off. An ominous white and purple glow appeared around her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, buck. That’s a tracking spell, isn’t it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In a few seconds, Archmage Twilight’s head turned to face his exact direction and seemed to search for something, or somepony. The spell faded and a glow from her horn was all the warning Espionage had before she appeared next to him.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hello, Esp. How’s the vacation going?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have got to be kidding!” Espionage exploded. “You work my chitin off day in and day out, and now that I’m on vacation, for the first time in my life, you show up to drag me back!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, poor Esp. I’m so sorry, I’ll just go back and find some other pony with the skills and experience necessary to keep the world from tearing itself apart.” The archmage turned as if to leave. “Oh, wait. You don’t have a choice in the matter. That was the deal with your queen. And you’re not exactly on good terms with your hive. Do you really want me to give you back?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…No.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good drone. I do intend to make this up to you. Give me a month of your time and then you can have the rest of the year off with pay.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage’s eyes widened. “Are you serious? You’re not just going to do this to me again, are you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I may keep you an extra week or two, but I can make due with just EIS after that. You have been doing a good job getting them in a serviceable state the past two years. You could do a better job of keeping Soulful Dust off my tail about sending you in to clean up the department, but whatever.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. Come pick us up in an hour. We’ll be ready then. We’re in room 1352 at the Mane Fair.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The archmage pulled out a watch from nowhere, nodded and disappeared.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, that was surprisingly generous. Let’s just hope Tavi isn’t too upset about ending our vacation early.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When traveling over land in Equestria, and in most other countries, if ones does not have wings then one takes the train. Of course, there was the rare exception like the archmage or the princess that had enough power to teleport around, but the train was the next best option.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A mid-twenties unicorn with a light-yellow coat. Her milky-white mane she had tied in a braid and her cutie mark was a pile of three hardcover books. She sat on the Ponyville bound line reading a book entitled <span style=" font-style:italic;">Entering the Dream Realm</span> which drew a few odd looks from the surrounding passengers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rather than the book, it was her reading glare, her posture, and the atmosphere of solitude she exuded that kept the seats next to and across from her empty. She was beginning to think nopony was going to sit next to her — and that was fine, she wasn’t on the clock until arriving in Ponyville — but then a purple earth pony appeared.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“May I sit here?” the purple pony asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The purple pony stored her bags in the overhead compartment and took her seat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Cheerilee, by the way,” the purple pony said, hoof extended.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Index Code. Index is fine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The two mares tapped hooves in the usual greeting and Index went back to reading her book. Cheerilee dipped her head down to get a look at the title.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s that book about?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index sighed internally and closed her book. She couldn’t afford to have a Ponyville resident start spreading bad rumors about her before she even got there.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s about lucid dreaming. In particular, it’s an instructional manual on how to learn to recognize when you’re dreaming.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee eyed the book, clearly more interested. “I’ve had a few lucid dreams before. I don’t remember them very well, but I do remember they were a lot of fun. Is there anywhere I could get a copy?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well…” Index idly played with the book, trying to think of what to say about her possession of a very old, restricted book. In the end, she decided part of the truth would do. “This is probably the last copy of this book, so you’d have to go through the Canterlot Archives to get it. They’d throw a fit if I lent it to anypony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s all right. So, you work for the government then?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Eh, sort of. I get shuffled around so much that I’m more of a consultant, but officially I am on Equestria’s payroll.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds tiring. I can’t imagine having to change jobs at all, let alone frequently.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index shrugged. “It’s not actually that bad. There are some things that I don’t get a chance for, but in exchange my job stays fresh and I get to see a lot of different places.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm… I guess I never thought of it that way. Celestia knows that the paperwork in teaching wears me down at times. Summer work especially. All the foals get to run around and cause mischief while I’m stuck inside.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I totally understand the feeling,” Index said, although for her summer meant all year.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have foals? How old?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Just one.” Index paused for a moment to consider just how old Spike was in terms of pony development. “He’s a little over nine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nine?” Cheerilee inspected Index with a measured eye. Index realized a little too late that as an elementary school teacher she would be well used to ponies of a particular age range. One that Index did not belong in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The circumstances were…beyond my control,” Index said, then blushed profusely when she realized the implications she just made. Hastily, she started self-destructing trying to explain herself. “That’s not what I meant! I mean, there was nothing nonconsensual going on. Not that’s not it either! There was nothing consensual either! I mean— It’s just— This isn’t coming out right. I haven’t— That is to say, I—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index gave up trying to explain away what she said and said, “He’s adopted.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The whirlwind of Index’s words over, Cheerilee smiled and replied, “That’s so sweet. I mean, I’m sure whatever caused that was terrible, but I’m amazed you took on that responsibility. How old were you when it happened?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s not actually a terrible backstory. He was just sort of found and we bonded about six years ago.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">All true in the most technical sense.</span> “I have no idea who his biological parents are.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s even sweeter. I wish there were more ponies like you in the world. It would mean the world for—” Cheerilee stopped abruptly and looked away, no doubt realizing she was just about to reveal confidential student information. “If you could please forget I said anything.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My lips are sealed. For reference, you could have just played that out into a comment about orphans in general. I might not have noticed anything then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee took a moment, reviewing her words and said, “Oh, I guess you’re right. I’ve never been very good at that kind of word play. That aside, tell me more about your colt.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you actually want to hear me gush about him?” Index asked. She had never enjoyed it when other ponies tried to tell her about their foals.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course! I love foals, even if they drive me insane during the school year. It’s why I’m an elementary teacher.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index took a deep breath. She figured it might be awhile before she got another one.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you want to run that by me again, Espionage?” asked Soulful Dusk, director of the EIS. Her messy, snow-white mane and tail stood out against her dark grey coat as usual.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage currently had the form of an all black pony without a cutie mark. It was his usual appearance around EIS since some of the lower rung members weren’t permitted to know about changelings.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Look, these orders are coming directly from the archmage and the princess, so put that magnifying glass cutie mark to work and start investigating.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soulful Dusk banged her head on her desk and accidentally hit her horn on some miscellaneous evidence. Rubbing it and wincing at times, she complained, “Ugh. And here I thought I was rid of you for a few weeks.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Same here,” Espionage retorted. “I was having a great time with Tavi and now I’m here on round-the-clock duty for a month. Fortunately for both of us, I’ve been promised the rest of the year off after that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soulful Dusk snapped back up with a huge smile. “Now <span style=" font-style:italic;">that</span> is welcome news.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A knock came at the door to Soulful Dusk’s office. She shouted for the new arrivals to come in and three ponies stepped inside. In front came Honorable Zeal, head of the EIS field agents. The captain of the Wonderbolts, Spitfire, and Zeal’s top agent, codename Double Donut Seven, were flanking him.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage greeted his orange pegasus friend with a double hoofpound as was their routine.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Zeal asked, “What are you doing back from paradise so soon, Esp? Don’t tell me Tavi finally got sick of you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She might have if the archmage hadn’t personally scared her stiff and told her about my upcoming five month vacation.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, now I’m jealous. I can’t keep getting left behind by the first changeling to fall in love, now can I? Ruins my reputation with the mares.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re already rock bottom in the books of every mare in Canterlot,” Spitfire scoffed. “Take a lesson from Double D Seven and maybe some miserable pony would consider it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ouch. But I know you don’t mean it, so I forgive you,” said Zeal, trying to put a foreleg around Spitfire’s shoulders only for it to be batted away by her wing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How’s your little brother doing in his love?” Espionage asked before those two started another hooffight. They had once started a lightning fight indoors and Soulful Dusk had seen fit to make Espionage clean up the mess for ‘instigating’ it under similar pretenses as the current ones.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No luck yet,” Zeal said, turning his attention from Spitfire, “but he claims the archmage is cracking. He really chose a hard one to pursue.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sirs,” Double Donut Seven interrupted. “I think the director is about to lose it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage turned around and saw that Soulful Dusk’s eyes were twitching and her forehooves were crushing an aluminum cup.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you three quite done?” she asked. Muttering to herself, she said, “I swear, must you do this every time…” Turning her attention back to the group, she told Espionage to fill the rest of group in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, so all three of you know we’ve been getting weird orders from the princess recently. The long and short of it is it turns out she has a sister called Nightmare Moon who’s coming home in a month and wants to take over Equestria.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Seeing the shocked and confused looks on the three new arrivals, Espionage told them to hold their questions until the end.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The princess has been trying to minimize the damage of whatever happens. However this ends, it’s likely we’ll have a new ruler plus or minus our current one. A couple days ago the archmage found out, got mad, and started hatching schemes with the princess. They have some sort of master plan going on that they have not deemed to share with us.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, our job is pretty simple, if laborious. We need to investigate everypony and every group that has any real influence in political or military matters and deal with any problems appropriately. This includes foreign powers. The archmage found out on her own so in theory any run-of-the-mill ambitious pony could too. We’ve dealt with night themed cults before, so that’s a bad sign already.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The last thing Equestria needs is a full blown civil war. If two goddesses want to fight to the bitter end over the throne, none of us can really do anything about that. What we can do is keep the rest of the country out of it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now, questions?” Espionage got three blank looks in response. “No? Good. Moving on.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Whoa, hold up,” Spitfire said. “Princess Celestia has a sister?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Look, I’m not going to answer any pointless questions.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine. But to clarify, our mission is to keep the world at peace and accept whatever happens?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“To the best of our ability, yes. We especially need to keep the ancient dragons neutral or asleep. Soulful Dusk, how many ancient dragons are awake right now?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fortunately just three, but if Nightmare Moon takes the field then they are bound to awaken the rest of them. Dragons tend to grow bitter and mean with age, but they are very honorable and would be bound by the Alicorn Accord to fight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right,” Espionage said, taking over again, “and I doubt any of us want the world to be reduced to ashes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The conversation paused as all five ponies stopped to envision the world ending in dragonfire and magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Espionage suspected the changelings might be able to survive the cataclysm with their fast, coordinated communication through the hives, but everypony else would not be so lucky. The world would burn and with it would go the ponies, the griffins, the horses, the zebras, and everything else. And then the changelings would starve to death.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even with the archmage’s magic granting him privacy, Espionage’s growing panic was slipping into a very confused hive.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wow,” Soulful Dusk said. “Suddenly I’m feeling a lot more motivated.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Me too,” chorused Zeal, Double Donut Seven, and Spitfire.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soulful Dusk prodded Espionage out of his thoughts with her magic. “Espionage, can you get the hive working on this with us?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… Yeah, probably,” Espionage said. He was pretty sure he could convince Queen Chrysalis to help. She was on very good terms with Equestria, if perhaps still a little wary at the hive being invited to stay in a country, but she was still very cross with Espionage for revealing their existence. “It might be better if the princess does the talking and I just relay the conversation.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nodding, Soulful Dusk said, “Understood. I’ll make the request as soon as we’re done here. Honorable Zeal, I want you to get every agent active. Start with domestic ponies and move out from there.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes sir,” Zeal responded, unusually formally with an accompanying salute.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Double Donut Seven, I need you to start infiltrating the griffins. They love war as it is and are looking to get revenge for their recent embarrassing defeat. Find out what they’re up to and the moment they find out about what’s happening in Equestria, send word our way.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What should we do about the griffin royal—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Imperial, Seven,” Soulful Dusk corrected. “The imperial family member. Don’t make that kind of mistake in The Griffin Kingdoms. They’re <span style=" font-style:italic;">very</span> touchy about it. As for…what’s her name again?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Gilda Alae the Fourth,” Double Donut Seven answered. “She’s in Cloudsdale as a student.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right. Honorable Zeal, keep an agent on her but don’t let her find out. It doesn’t really matter where she is or what she does, so long as she doesn’t cause any incidents. Griffins couldn’t care less about hostages, so we shouldn’t even bother. We only need to make sure she doesn’t give the griffins a legitimate reason to invade.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Getting a nod form Zeal, Soulful Dusk continued, “Spitfire, get all of the Wonderbolts on a ‘training exercise’ around Equestria. Look for anything out of the ordinary and then spread out to the borders. Keep an eye of foreign movements, but more importantly watch over the domestic troops.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spitfire thought for a moment then asked, “What reason should I give for the presence of Wonderbolts everywhere on Equestrian borders?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No idea,” Soulful Dusk said, shrugging. “Whatever you come up with, run it by me first.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Espionage, work with Honorable Zeal. You know best how to direct changelings so you’ll be in charge of them. Also, if the princess doesn’t mind, try bringing other hives to Equestria. We’ll need all the help we can get so we’d appreciate it if you all could set aside whatever interhive politics your race practices.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No guarantee on that. Hives get together occasionally but if we stay together too long we start…merging you could say. With how long we’ve been living in Equestria, my queen is probably the strongest and few others would be willing to give up their power with the fate of the world merely uncertain.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll mention that to the princess. Maybe she’ll come up with some incentive beyond peace and a filled stomach.” Seeing her comrades idling, she added, “Well? Get to work. You all have your orders.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The magic powered train pulled into its first southbound stop with a mighty hiss of thaumic energies being released. Those sensitive to the flow of magic would feel the dissipation of a large quantity of energy into the ground as the breaks did their work.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Several dozen ponies quit the locomotive for the station and at the end came Index and Cheerilee. Their conversation had eventually left foals and allowed Index to learn a lot about Ponyville. More recently they had moved on to Index’s business in Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So where are you going to be staying while overseeing the festival?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I think I’m staying with the Ponyville hospitality director or something like that,” answered Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, that would be Pinkie Pie then. You should have lots of fun with her, although you may want to take her in small doses at first.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index recovered her bulkier luggage from train engineer and turned back to Cheerilee who only had saddlebags with her. Her questioning look prompted Cheerilee to point across the platform.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even through the crowd of ponies, it was easy to see what was waiting on the other end just next to the exit. An earth pony that oozed pink was standing on her hind legs, waving around a greeting sign labeled ‘Welcome to Ponyville, Index!’ above her head. She was surrounded by what could only be called a flock of balloons. Next to her was something Index could just barely make out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Is— Is that a cannon? What possible use does she have for a cannon?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was only for a fleeting moment, but Index and Pinkie Pie locked eyes. Suddenly, as quick as teleportation for normal pony reflexes, she was at Index’s side with their forehooves locked. Reflexively, Index flung her away with enough strength to send her flying out of the station, but a blink later she was back and on the other side of Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was all Index could do to control her reflexes and not send the unnatural earth pony to Saddle Lake or retreat herself to a random location far away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This time instead of locking arms, Pinkie Pie went for a tight hug and knocked Index onto her rear, the whole time continuing the hug.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Welcome to Ponyville, Index! We’re so glad to have you here!” Pinkie Pie spewed off almost faster than Index could process which was a disturbing thought all on its own. “I’m so sorry for surprising you like that. My name is Pinkie Pie, but I bet you already knew that. I live at the Sugarcube Corner where you’ll be staying with me and the Cakes. That’s a capital C, not that there aren’t lowercase c cakes there too. Mayor Mare arranged for you to stay with us. We’re going to have so much fun together. Your welcome party’s tonight too. You’ll be able to meet a good chunk of Ponyville but not all of it. The Sugarcube Corner just isn’t big enough to host a party for the entire town. If you want to make it in time we’ll have to get going. The mayor wants to say hello to you personally and who knows how long that will take. She’s always so bogged down in paperwork and red tape and all that. I’ve got your luggage, so let’s go.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was being pulled from the station by the firm grip of Pinkie Pie who at some unknown time had broken off the hug and acquired Index’s luggage from her telekinetic grip. At some point, the confetti cannon had gone off but the platform was completely clean of any mess Pinkie Pie could have left behind.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was only one hope without breaking cover. Index turned around to stare pleadingly at Cheerilee.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The elementary teacher just waved goodbye.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After being dragged across town and given the name of every pony they passed on the way, Pinkie Pie gave Index over to the custody of a sympathetic looking blue earth pony. She introduced herself as Berry Nectar, assistant and secretary to the mayor. Her red and black striped mane and tail matched her name well, but surprisingly her cutie mark as an hourglass.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">While Pinkie Pie waited downstairs, Berry guided Index upstairs to just outside the mayor’s office. It was a party free zone and very comforting after dealing with the local party pony.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Minutes passed with Index sitting and trying to comprehend how an earth pony had managed to do the less interesting half of what she had seen. <span style=" font-style:italic;">Celestia</span> would have trouble moving at the speeds Pinkie Pie had displayed. And Index still had no clue how she managed to clean up the station without being noticed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Berry Nectar returned with a cup of hot chocolate. It seemed an odd drink to have around in summer, but it helped.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Probably stored in a cabinet labeled ‘In case of Pinkie Pie.’</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shortly, Index was invited inside the office proper. The mayor’s office was surprisingly tidy for a governing official. Index knew her own was a mess and Celestia’s was even worse. Most other mayors had a similar problem when she visited.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">On one wall was a chalkboard with franticly drawn diagrams and several documents pinned to it by magnets. It seemed to be trying to identify the ‘source of chaos’ in Ponyville without much luck. Index was unsurprised to see Pinkie Pie was a prime suspect.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Deciding to give further investigation a miss, she took her seat across from the mayor’s desk. The unfortunately named, Mayor Mare — the name plate said Mayor Mayor Mare — was a light tan coated earth pony with gray and white mane and tail and wore browline glasses. Overall, she gave Index the impression of trying to appear older than she actually was.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Looking up from a folder she was riffling through, Mayor Mare spotted the hot chocolate floating nearby.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After introduction were made, Mayor Mare said, “Please accept my apologies for Pinkie Pie, Index. I try to reel in her craziness, but it only helps so much.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s okay,” Index said with the lie completely obvious to anypony that heard it. “I’ve coped with less friendly monstrosities.” Index realized what she said a split second after it came out. “I didn’t mean—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s alright,” Mayor Mare interrupted. “I <span style=" font-style:italic;">fully</span> understand and sympathize. You build up a tolerance after a while, but your first exposure to Pinkie is something you never forget.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you know how she does it? I would say she’s breaking the rules, but that would discredit me as an academic forever.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She’s just an earth pony like me…” Mayor Mare reassured Twilight, but the unease in her voice was far from convincing. “I can understand if you would like different accommodations.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. I couldn’t do that. I have a month here that will be simply awful if I don’t make any friends. I can’t start out by snubbing local kindness.”<span style=" font-style:italic;"> And besides that, I </span>have<span style=" font-style:italic;"> to investigate this phenomenon. She could be the breakthrough I’ve been seeking.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s nopony in town that would hold fleeing from Pinkie against you,” Mayor Mare counseled. “We understand better than anypony that she can be a bit too much.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll keep that in mind, but I can deal with her…eventually. I just wasn’t expecting…” Index faltered for words, trying to find laypony words for how Index would describe the anomaly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pinkie,” Mayor Mare finished.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Yeah. She might as well be given her own category.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I admire your bravery. After your party tonight, she’ll cool off. A bit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index gulped, then nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, on to business. We started planning the moment we received word we would be hosting the festival this year.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The mayor pushed over the folder she had been holding earlier. “You can refer to this dossier for most of the details we’ve worked out so far. I can summarize it if you’d like.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index could probably read the entire document faster than Mayor Mare could highlight it, but she gave the nod anyway.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s two major parts of the celebration. There’s the usual festivities like street performers, dancing, plays, rides, food, et cetera. We’ve contracted several specific entertainers to come. They’ll be arriving sporadically between now and the week before. The usual carnival events will arrive within a couple weeks but won’t be set up until a few days before the solstice.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hang on a second.” Index had been following along in the dossier and had it open to the list of performances on the city’s bit. “Who’s Beatrix Lulamoon? She sounds familiar.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Beatrix is a traveling showpony. She does a magic act under the stage name Trixie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course!” Index shouted rising from her chair in her excitement and posing like the mare in question. “Nopony could ever forget The Great and Powerful Trixie. She blew up the auditorium twice and the music room before they expelled her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Err… Maybe we should reconsider—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, no.” Index waved her hoof at the very thought of the idea. “This will be great. At a distance, there’s no better entertainment than her. And if she’s a showpony now, she must have learned more control. Or swindled some poor insurance company. Either way, we be remiss to deny the world Trixie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Right. Moving on. For the actual ceremony we have Vinyl Scratch volunteering to manage the music and sound systems. We also have no small number of carpenters, professional and hobbyist, in town building stages and other temporary structures. Big Macintosh of Sweet Apple Acres is in charge of that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“His little sister, Applejack, is heading up organization of catering for the reception for the notables. There’s a number of other ponies working with her to even out her, well, her rather unnatural fondness for apples. Please don’t tell her I said that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We managed to get Octavia Melody and her group to come play at the reception as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index facehoofed. “Please tell me you’re not talking about the one from Canterlot.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The mayor was obviously confused. “Is that a problem?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Only for me.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">Esp is going to be such a pain when he finds out Octavia’s close to danger.</span> “Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, then next would be decorations. When the time comes, Pinkie will be in charge of that. Good news for you,” Mayor Mare joked. “You’ll have some guaranteed freedom from her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Getting an eye roll in response, the mayor continued, “Lastly we have a promise from the royal guard to help out with security and peacekeeping the week before the festival until it’s over. We expect a huge influx of ponies during that time for the festival so naturally we’ll need the guard’s help. Along a similar line of thought, we’re working on building a bunch of inns to house them in although we don’t know if we’ll be able to make enough in time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see. If that becomes a major concern I’ll put in a request for some magical assistance. The princess and the archmage will probably help clean up their own mess.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“About that, if you don’t mind my asking, why is Ponyville hosting the Summer Sun Celebration at all? Not that we’re not grateful, but it’s always been held in a large city before. And admittedly they are much better equipped to do so.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s an excellent question. I don’t really know either. From what I understand, you’d have to ask Princess Celestia or Archmage Twilight Sparkle directly to get an answer. If you want my speculations, I would say that they just want a day or two in the country to relax for once.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both mares stopped to enjoy a laugh.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyway, if that’s everything important” — Index waited for the mayor to nod — “then I should explain my job. It’s pretty simple, especially with Ponyville being smaller than usual. I’m here to make sure you don’t crash and burn and to help out if you run into trouble, but you have complete creative control.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll expect updates once and a while, but not in real time. Have fun with this and if you do well then the powers that be might add Ponyville to the regular list for hosting events.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’d appreciate that. We have a lot of exporting with the head branch of the Apple family here, but we could really use the tourism.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rising, Index said, “It was good to meet you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Same here. I’ve have Berry keep our records up to date so whenever you want to pick updates up you can just ask her for them. If you have any questions, I’ll be glad to see you as well.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The Sugarcube Corner was by no means a large store, but it dedicated most of its floorspace to two rooms. There was the kitchen that was packed to the brim with ovens and raw ingredients. Then there was the front of house that boasted no less than thirty tables which, when cleared out, provided plenty of space for parties.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie Pie had gone all out — at least Index hoped this was all out — and had invited several hundred ponies. The whirlwind of introductions had gone by so fast that even Index had trouble remembering every name. To her relief, Pinkie Pie had not insisted on escorting her the entire night and had left to play some party games with other ponies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was not fond of parties of any kind, but she was here to make friends and there would probably never be a better chance to start. At least this one was not as bad as the Grand Galloping Gala.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pass,” said Derpy, a cross-eyed, gray pegasus.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index studied Vinyl Scratch carefully. As far as Index could tell, the white coated DJ had no tells, or if she did then they were blocked by those infernal sunglasses she insisted on wearing indoors at night. Vinyl had five cards left and if she went out first, her team would have enough points to win the game.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s own partner, a light yellow baker that had introduced herself as Sweetie Drops, though most ponies called her Bon Bon for some inexplicable reason, had led a single full house. Index was pretty sure Vinyl had a bomb left, considering she had one-upped Index nearly every round in this exact same situation, but the rounds where Index had assumed that had cost her team dearly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index hesitantly lifted four sevens from her hand but stopped short of playing them and pushed them back down. A moment later she realized she had just done something incredibly stupid.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Horseapples! Now they know I have a four-of-a-kind. No wait, I can bluff my way through this.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index looked at Vinyl again and saw the mare was smirking. It was exactly the same kind of pitying smile Index made when she was dragged into Celestia’s school as a guest lecturer for nine year old foals.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Curse these locals and their stupid game.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index plucked a full house from her hand and softly slammed it onto the trick. She looked at her opponent and noticed the small movements of her chest.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">She’s laughing at me! Argh.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Vinyl laid her entire hand down on the trick. She had had a five long straight flush.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index gaped and then collapsed onto the table. <span style=" font-style:italic;">It didn’t even matter…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Now her own partner was laughing at her. “You’re not <span style=" font-style:italic;">that</span> bad, Index.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. I was way worse the first time I played.” Index rotated her head to look at Derpy. “You’ve obviously got the memory and skills for the game. You just lack experience.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s attention was turned to Vinyl who took over. “A big part of this game is learning how your opponents play.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So you’re saying I can win if I get to know you better?” <span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s conveniently in line with my mission.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We,” Sweetie Drops corrected. “<span style=" font-style:italic;">We</span> could win.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Of course.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not the only reason we lost, but your teamwork is abysmal.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At the accusation, Index buried her head in her hooves and moaned thereby eliciting more laughs from the other three.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s too late to play again tonight, but I’m free tomorrow if you’d like.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The clock at the end of Sweetie Belle’s gaze showed it was barely past ten. <span style=" font-style:italic;">That is going to take some getting used to.</span> <span style=" font-style:italic;">Kinda see where Luna is coming from when ponies go to bed this early.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That would be great. My job is pretty easy for once and I’ve got <span style=" font-style:italic;">a lot</span> of free time until the festival is over.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What about you two?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nah. Mayor’s sending me to Canterlot for a few days to work out festival stuff with Octavia Melody.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie Drops paused in gathering the cards. “The cellist?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why am I the only pony that’s never heard of her?” Vinyl threw the tricks she had taken towards Sweetie Drops.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because you don’t listen to classical music,” Derpy explained. “I keep telling you to listen to something other than wubs.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ignoring Vinyl’s grumbling, Sweetie Drops asked, “What about you, Derpy?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I have to work late tomorrow. Lots a mail coming in tomorrow.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm… Well, Lyra will want to play, of course. Cheerilee will probably be busy…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I think Minuette is free,” offered Vinyl.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ooh, she hasn’t had time to play in a while. That’ll be fun.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After cleaning up, Vinyl and Derpy excused themselves while Sweetie Drops explained when and where to meet tomorrow. It turned out that Sweetie Drops lived on the outskirts of town, although Ponyville wasn’t that big. She also insisted on making the meeting a dinner date as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With their arrangements made, Sweetie Drops left for home and Index went back to the dwindling party. It wasn’t long before Pinkie Pie showed amazing restraint and actually ended the affair and sent everypony home.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once the last pony was out the door, Pinkie Pie appeared as mysteriously at Index’s side as earlier today. “Now comes the after-party where we stay up all night playing games and telling each other about ourselves.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Err…” Index was avoiding Pinkie Pie’s face, trying to come up with some excuse. “Do we have too? I’m pretty tired from the trip and the party.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okie Dokie Loki.” Relief came to Index but was cut short when Pinkie Pie added, “We don’t have to play games. Now come on, I’ll show you to our room.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-style:italic;">Our </span>room?” asked Index, resisting a groan.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah! The Cakes don’t have any other extra rooms, what with the restaurant and the kitchen but our room’s not so small that you need to worry about it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This called for the Royal Breathing Excersizes that Cadance had taught Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ooh! That looks interesting!” Pinkie Pie mirrored Index’s hoof movements and breathing. “Oh! That’s <span style=" font-style:italic;">so</span> relaxing! I’ll have to do this before bed every night!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The door to their room opened to reveal a modestly sized bedroom just big enough for two. Index had expected it to be as chaotic as the mare it belonged to, but it appeared that Pinkie Pie was either naturally tidy or had cleaned up the day before. Stashed in far corner of the room were the beds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Nice! Bunk be— Why am I still excited about that? Twilight, you’re way past your filly years.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you want the top bunk?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With a hybrid of a jump and a float, Index landed on the top bunk as her answer. Across the room she spied her luggage Pinkie Pie had taken at the train station not that I mattered. Everything important was stored extra-dimensionally; the luggage was just to say she had some without exposing her spellcasting talent.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">From below came the sound of Pinkie Pie squeezing under the her blankets.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, Index. Why have you been avoiding magic all night?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Taken off guard by the unexpected question, Index delayed a little too long before she responded, “What do you mean?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, earlier when you were getting a refill of punch for yourself and Vinyl, your horn lit up for the tiniest fraction of a second and then went out. You’ve been doing that all night and all day, but only when it would make sense to be using some magic or another, not randomly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How odd…” was all Index said, while thinking, <span style=" font-style:italic;">This mare is unnaturally observant.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She had made a preliminary scan of Pinkie Pie in secret earlier and each and every test had supported the position that Pinkie Pie was a regular earth pony. No special magic, no enchantments, no anything that could explain the weirdness.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t have an answer. I could make guesses, but nothing better. What about you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What about what about me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You are… I don’t even know. You’re really fast or something and who knows what else.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie Pie giggled and said, “Of course I am. How else would I be able to throw such great parties and bring smiles to everypony in town and stuff?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even expecting a non-answer, that still made Index scowl. “Whatever. I’ll figure it out on my own.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">Hopefully.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, where are you from?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Canterlot.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh. You know Vinyl and Lyra are from Canterlot. We get a lot of visitors from there passing through but nopony ever stays.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Myself, I was born on a rock farm south of Dodge Junction. My dad’s Igneous Rock and is pretty stuffy and spends all day digging up rocks, rocks, and more rocks. My mom’s Cloudy Quartz and she’s <span style=" font-style:italic;">so</span> strict that I couldn’t wait to leave home. She didn’t even want me to throw parties! I have three sisters, Marble, Limestone, and Maud. The first two are a lot like dad but Maud is <span style=" font-style:italic;">way</span> different. She’s super quite and reserved but once you get past that she’s the life of the party.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Most of the ponies here were born in Ponyville but Caramel and Action shot moved here from just outside the badlands though I never met them back home. What about your family?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…There’s my parents, brother, sister-in-law, niece, and colt.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">This is going to be a </span>long<span style=" font-style:italic;"> night.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re a mom? What about your super special somepony?” Taking Index’s sigh as having asked the wrong question, Pinkie verbosely apologized for brining up a missing partner.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s nopony missing, dead, estranged, or otherwise out of touch with me. My colt is adopted. And before you start up again, there was no tragedy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh! How old is he?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“He must be adorable!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, he is. Very much so. But he’s also a troublemaker. Even more so when he’s with his cousin though they’re nothing compared to the stories I heard tonight about the Cutie Mark Crusaders.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Those fillies really know how to have fun! Just a few days ago they put on a huge rock show for all of Ponyville and the week before that they set fire to pond across town and before that—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Come again?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You didn’t hear about that one? It’s probably the bestest, most exciting, mind-boggling thing they’ve done yet. It all started ten days ago when Diamond Tiara bet that they couldn’t jump the pond…”</p>
<p align="center" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
