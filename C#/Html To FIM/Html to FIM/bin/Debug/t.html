<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The Hook</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the far reaches of Canterlot Castle, high above in the towers lives a mare. Everypony knows of her, but few have met her. Many have tried to exploit her connection with Celestia. None have succeeded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight Sparkle sighs, having turned away another noble seeking favors before even reaching the top of the stairs. She often wonders how much needs to go wrong in a pony for constant political squabbling to be fulfilling.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As the archmage of Equestria, Twilight is above such petty disputes. She does what is required of her position (and personal favors for her only friend, Celestia) and then returns to seclusion and research.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The politicians that annoy Twilight daily look upon her and see the position, the status.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Is she not powerful? Is she not great?</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight, now reading through dusty scrolls and long forgotten tales, writes in her notes. Notes gathering dust of their own. A brief thought flashes through her mind as she fervidly writes.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Am I not powerful? Am I not great?</span></p>

<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Short Description</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Archmage Twilight Sparkle barely sleeps between her duties, her research, and raising Spike. Now she also has to deal with an evil goddess’s return. It would have been nice if Celestia had mentioned this a year ago…</p>

<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Prelude - Creativity</p>
<p align="center" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">A brilliant multichromatic streak fills the sky and something somewhere stirs.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight Sparkle knew little about magic but even she knew when to be impressed. Her own clumsy attempts at telekinesis left much to be desired and were nothing compared to what she really wanted to see today.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sure, the festival was fun and she would probably have a sore stomach later, even with the digestion of a four year old filly. But this year, Twilight was going to witness Princess Celestia raise the sun.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had just one problem: she was lost.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When she heard it was almost time for the sun to rise, Twilight had rushed off in the general direction of the ceremony and, almost immediately, was separated from her family by the migrating crowd.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excuse me,” Twilight began only to have the mare ignore her, or perhaps simply not hear her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um,” Twilight said, trying to get a stallion’s attention who was otherwise occupied in conversation and moving faster than Twilight could keep up.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Okay, Twilight. Don’t cry. So what if nopony cares? Momma told me to find somepony to help me if I—I get lost. I… I can…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And then Twilight started crying as the crowd shuffled around her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After what seemed like hours to Twilight, but was probably seconds, a unicorn with a lime green coat and strawberry cake cutie mark came up to her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, you poor filly. Are you lost?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight sniffed and nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you know where your family is?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight shook her head and stammered, “I w—was headed to the c—cera—ceremony and—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’ll be alright,” the mare said raising Twilight to her back with her magic. “We’ll just head right over and get you a good view of the crowd and Princess Celestia.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight managed to bring her tears down to a runny nose and thanked her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Who are you?” Twilight asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Daisy. And what’s your name?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Twilight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How pretty. Much better than Daisy anyway.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And good manners too. Are you a princess?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight giggled and said, “no way.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, even so you’d do well as one. You want to know a secret?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you give your name first before asking for somepony else’s you’ll seem really sophisticated and friendly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really? Just that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep. Silly isn’t it. But it works. Oh, we’re already here. Your parents are probably nearby since we were so close.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The pair stood at the outskirts of a massive crowd gathered in front of the grand stage where Celestia would raise the sun. The stage was already littered with various nobles and other ponies of import, all waiting on the arrival of their princess.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh dear,” Daisy said. “We’ll never be able to see anything back here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But don’t worry. Just hold on tight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A glow emanated from Daisy’s horn and the two flew into the sky and landed on a nearby roof.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That was amazing!” Twilight shouted. “I’ve never seen a unicorn fly before. How did you do that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I graduated near the top of the class at Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep. I was no match for the real monsters…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Monsters? Princess Celestia accepts monsters at her school?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, no. That’s just an expression. What I mean is, there were some very talented ponies I couldn’t compete with. But even then I wasn’t too shabby myself. I don’t know many spells, nor am I that powerful, but a little creativity goes a long, long way.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s eyes were positively glowing with admiration.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, can you do any magic yet?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight looked down and rubbed the roof with her hoof. “Not really. I can barely turn a page…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s pretty good actually. When I was your age I couldn’t so much as move a balloon. Of course, now I can lift myself up upon roofs. With a passenger.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So that’s how you did it! But if it’s that easy, why don’t I see other unicorns flying around?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy shrugged. “Most ponies never look outside the box. They see everypony else using telekinesis solely for moving other things and never think to turn it on themselves. The same is true for other spells as well. Rarely does a pony see a magic and repurpose it for a different task. I hope you won’t be so silly as you grow up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you really think I can be that smart?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not about being smart. Just keep looking for alternate solutions to problems and different ways to use magic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm.” Twilight stared thoughtfully towards the stage.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Even with your magic still developing, I’m sure you can think of other uses for it besides turning book pages. Perhaps not right away, or right now, but maybe tomorrow, or the day after, or next week. The important part is not to be discouraged if nothing comes to mind or if you come up with an idea that doesn’t work. Even bad ideas should be treated as a step in the right direction.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because you want to encourage yourself to think of ideas at all, not punish yourself for being creative and having things not work out.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s foalish.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, it is. But unfortunately, we’re all pretty foalish inside.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight looked skeptical and Daisy just laughed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Just remember what I’ve said. You’ll understand in time. Oh and here’s another secret. Don’t make a habit of using telekinesis for moving yourself around. Walk most of the time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because,” Daisy began, then moved closer to Twilight to whisper, “you’ll get fat.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight gasped then looked questioningly at Daisy, but was too polite to ask.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see that look you have. It’s true. Those were…not my better years.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy smiled and Twilight couldn’t help but giggle once more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then a fanfare of trumpets called out announcing the arrival of Princess Celestia. The alicorn seemed to glow in the early hours as she approached the stage. This being the first time Twilight had ever seen the princess, she couldn’t help but gape.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight could hear Daisy stifle a laugh and quickly shut her mouth but couldn’t help the stare.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia gave a long speech that Twilight barely paid any attention to and was soon banished from her memory by the splendor that followed. Celestia glowed as she rose into the sky above the stage and with her came the sun rising above the horizon. The sun’s rays outlined Celestia in the air as her horn grew ever brighter. The sky moved from black to purple to red to yellow and finally took on a familiar blue, each shade seeming to complement Celestia in a different way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When Celestia returned to the stage the crowd cheered and Twilight cheered with them. Eventually the crowd died down, Princess Celestia left, and everypony went back to enjoying the Summer Sun Celebration in their own way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And now that we have some proper light,” Daisy said, pulling Twilight’s attention back to her, “let’s see if we can find your parents.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light carried two stacks of eleven books to the second story and knocked on five year old Twilight’s door.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Come in.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s door swung open and Night Light stepped inside, books in tow.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, sweetie. We picked up the library books you asked for.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight let out a small squee and hugged Night Light.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light set the books down returning Twilight’s hug. “No problem. We’re always happy to get you any books you want.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When their hug ended, Twilight quickly pulled out the forth book of the nearest stack and started reading.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light smiled and as he left the room said, “Have fun.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Closing the door behind him, Night Light retreated to the company of his wife downstairs.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I still can’t believe it,” Velvet said. “What are the chances we get two geniuses out of two fillies?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light shrugged. “Either really good, or really bad. I suspect the second is easier when the first is mostly grown and you know what to do.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Maybe.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Still I’m a bit worried about her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ve had this conversation before dear.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know. It’s just, Shining had trouble making friends being both smart and enjoying being smart. It’s sad that foals work that way. But Twilight. She doesn’t even seem to care. It’s like she doesn’t even notice they exist.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She took to Cadance quickly enough.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cadance is over three times her age. Even leaving that alone, she’s a skilled spellcaster. She’s more of a teacher to Twilight than a friend.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I think Shining may have put it best. He does have a better understanding of her mentality. ‘It doesn’t matter if she never has a single friend in her life so long as she’s enjoying herself.’ I know it’s odd, but who are we to question what she enjoys?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Her parents.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That doesn’t mean we should try to change who she is. Altering her utility function would be tantamount to killing her. Of course then we’d have a new filly running around the house.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light sighed and collapsed onto the sofa next to Velvet. “Why did I ever marry a philosopher?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You know why,” Velvet said, a knowing smile creeping up her face.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Heh. Oh yeah.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shining Armor always knew where to find Twilight. He didn’t even have to use a tracking spell. If Twilight wasn’t with Cadance or out with the family then she was in her room reading or practicing magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It had been almost a year since he moved out and he had some free time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shining burst into Twilight’s room and shouted, “LSBFF!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“BBBFF!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The two hugged in the traditional way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What brings you here, Shining?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I had some free time and wanted to see my adorable little sister now that she’s six years old.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The smallest and subtlest frown passed over Twilight’s face before returning to a smile. “Oh? So what should we do.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, I saw that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Saw what?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That frown. What’s wrong.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nothing. I was just at a bad point to stop reading. But it’s no problem. Let’s go have some fun together!”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight Velvet and Night Light returned late at night and found Cadance sitting next to a sleeping Twilight, now seven, whose face was firmly planted into a book. This had happened several times before but each time was just as adorable as the last for Velvet and Night Light.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks for foal sitting Twi again, Cadance,” Velvet said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s no trouble at all. All I have to do is give Twi a new book and she entertains herself the entire night.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Mom? Dad?” Twilight said, sitting down at the table. “Could you look over these papers for me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Papers?” Velvet looked on questioningly, taking the papers. “This is an application to Princess Celestia’s school. And the scholarship application as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We were going to fill these out for you and surprise you next week just after your birthday.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, sorry about that. You don’t suppose I could get a different surprise, could I?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sure we can come up with something,” Night Light mused.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Velvet thought for a moment and then said, “I think I have a good idea.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What is it?” Twilight asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It wouldn’t be a surprise if I told you, now would it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose not.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’ll just have to wait. And when you least expect it,” Velvet trailed off, nudging Night Light under the table.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A brief pause and Night Light continued, “Bam! Surprise and happy times!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight jumped, shocked by Night Light taking over the sentence, then started laughing.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Twilight. T. Why can’t ponies pick names like…Zel…or Xyn…um…Water Lilly. That one’s good. All this waiting is so, very, </span>stressful<span style=" font-style:italic;">. What’s the point of having a name like Twilight if you just get shuffled to the back of every single alphabetized list.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight sighed. Her written exams went perfectly. At least it was her opinion that they did. Twilight put considerable stock in her ability to judge herself. All that remained was the practical test. A test that, for some bizarre reasoning, the proctors decided needed to be done one applicant at a time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A proctor approached Twilight where she sat with a sweet smile. “Twilight Sparkle?” She asked as a formality to confirm despite Twilight being the only other pony in the room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you would follow me, we’re ready to start your practical examination.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight followed the mare down a couple hallways into a large lecture hall where an entire panel of proctors, or what Twilight referred to as judges, waited to decide her fate. A small cart with a large egg rested in front of them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is that a dragon egg?” Twilight asked, wondering what possible reason such a thing would be present.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes it is,” the center judge replied. He was an old stallion, a small white beard growing from his chin. His dark gray coat did nothing to help him look younger. His weak smile looked worn from dealing with more fillies than anypony his age should. “I’m glad to see an applicant that is so knowledgeable.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am Dean Weatherby,” he continued. “This year’s practical exam is to for you to hatch this dragon egg.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was speechless.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not all applicants are successful, and not all successful applicants will successfully hatch the egg. If their written exams are outstanding.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Not all applicants successfully hatch the egg? How about ‘no applicants are successful.’ Hatching a dragon egg is hard enough, and I can tell from here that they have additional spells preventing it from hatching. What are they really testing here?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That said, do try your best. I remember your brother was very talented and we expect good things from you as well. You have up to twenty minutes to try any approach you wish.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, that certainly makes a filly less nervous. Sigh…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">So, given that it’s obvious they don’t expect anypony to hatch the egg, what do they want to see? Creative approaches? Raw power? Knowledge that this shouldn’t be possible? Maybe some combination of the three? Do they want me to try even knowing?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I suppose I should at least see what spells they put on the egg.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight sat down next to the egg and started to direct small scale probing spells at it. After a few minutes of sitting completely still staring at the egg, having done nothing apparently interesting (for the proctors where not yet monitoring what spells Twilight was using), the proctors looked a bit bored. Weatherby gave them a stern glare but was unable to get them to focus on Twilight after a long day of examinations.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This is some of the laziest spellcraft I have </span>ever<span style=" font-style:italic;"> seen. I suppose I can’t expect anypony my age to notice, let alone be able to pick it apart, but still, I’m rather insulted. They could have at least tried. What if somepony actually managed to hatch the egg and mother or father a dragon? I can only imagine what…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What if that pony was me? The only worry is that pesky time limit. I’m not old enough to brute force this.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A glint came into Twilight’s eye that only Dean Weatherby noticed. He immediately started checking what Twilight was doing and simply looked on in shock as Twilight picked at weak points in the spells they placed to prevent anypony from actually hatching the egg. From the progress she was making, she would have them all off a few minutes before time was called.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dean Weatherby wondered what he should do. He could call the test just in case, but he was curious how far the little filly could get. The fillies at his school caused all kinds of trouble and wacky hijinks (all of which he secretly laughed at as he scolded the troublemakers), but this one promised to take the cake. He could just imagine the priceless looks when he told the other proctors what the little filly was doing to their spells while they sat bored.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then he was called back to the room from his thoughts (much to his regret) as Twilight stamped the ground, apparently in frustration. Quickly checking the clock, he noticed ten minutes had passed while he laughed at his thoughts.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight rooted herself to the ground harder and Weatherby considered that somepony had put on a particularly good spell and checked once more to see what the filly was doing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Weatherby probed the magic surrounding Twilight to figure out what was frustrating her so much. All he determined was that she was dumping out a lot of raw magical power. He pondered what spell she could be trying to brute force counter. Weatherby checked the egg to determine what spells were left on it and jumped out of his chair, startling the other proctors who had begun to pay attention. The little filly had finished faster than he expected!</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wait!” Weatherby called out to Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">However Twilight was too focused on pushing as much magic as she could into the egg to notice.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why! Don’t! You! Hatch! Fine, I’ll put everything I have into you and buck how tired it makes me!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight through as much magic as she possibly could into the dragon egg and the world stopped.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">*Crack*</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Everyone heard it. The sound of an egg cracking. Seconds passed in silence, broken only by further cracking sounds from the egg. After a minute had passed the newly born dragon rolled out of its egg.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then as if to punctuate this event, a deafening boom resounded, seemingly from the north-west, yet with no discernible source.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After everypony’s hearing returned, the only sound was the cry of the newborn dragon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Exhausted, Twilight struggled to sit up from where she had collapsed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There. I did it. Now don’t give any— any impossible— tests any— anymore,” Twilight stammered out before collapsing once more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The proctors could only stare in silence. Except for Weatherby, who made sure to enjoy his peers’s expressions as much as he thought he would.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Weatherby sat with his fellow proctors, deciding which applicants they would accept and which they would be forced to turn away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia took it as her personal responsibility to be here at her school to make sure merit and ability were always the deciding factors. Each time she showed up late, as she did today, she always reviewed the decisions already made (disturbingly fast to Weatherby, as if she threw off any pretense of mortality the alicorn put on to keep her subjects at ease around her). Further, she always started with reviewing the rejections.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia had only overruled an application decision he made once in his three decades as the head of the school. For one Sunset Shimmer. He knew better than to gloat to Celestia after what Sunset did, but he still wanted to. Even two decades later.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">He could see the hurt every time she had to agree with a rejection and wondered why she subjected herself to this and wouldn’t simply trust his judgment.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After finishing reviewing the rejections, she moved on to the accepted applicants. Each one she was able to accept seemed to heal some of the hurt of the rejections, though not all.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once Celestia had caught up, the meeting continued. They were about halfway through the applications and he was eager to see how she was going to react to the one at the very bottom.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Each application came and went and finally they reached Twilight Sparkle’s.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So,” said Weatherby. “Does anypony have any objections to Twilight Sparkle?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nopony said a word but Celestia’s brow furled.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Weatherby?” Celestia began.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes?” Weatherby responded, thinking, <span style=" font-style:italic;">This is going to be good</span>.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“One of my guards is Shining Armor, and I often hear him talking about his sister Twilight and how talented she is. I see that she even aced the written exams. But please tell me why the only comment on the practical section is ‘A mother.’”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, I would have expected you would know if Shining won’t stop talking about her,” Weatherby began with playful delight he hadn’t had a chance for in years. “It’s recent, so I can understand you haven’t heard from Shining, but she is a mother.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please elaborate how an eight year old filly manages to give birth to anything.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not as difficult as it sounds. All you need is a dragon egg.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia’s blank look was priceless. She often had a blank look of one kind or another to hide her emotions when dealing with politicians, but Weatherby knew her well enough to know this was not one of the usual.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Did you change the practical exam without notifying me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nope.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So you’re saying—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She stripped off the protections and hatched it properly, yes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia opened her mouth and shut it again, words failing her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Finally, Celestia said, “Please reject Twilight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excuse me?” Weatherby said incredulously, “Why?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because there’s no grade we can put her in that could possibly keep pace with <span style=" font-style:italic;">her</span>.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You can’t tell her to teach herself!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course not. It’s been a long time since the last one, but even I am entitled to take on a student.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Miss Twilight Sparkle,</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">You will have to excuse the hoofwritten letter. I am afraid we do not have a standard letter for your case. I regret to inform you that Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns is unable to accept you as a student despite your excellent written and practical examinations.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That said, another offer is being prepared for you (if you have not already received it by mail) that you should find quite exciting.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Dean Weatherby</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Head of Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight barely finished reading the letter before she decided that this was, in fact, the worst day of her life. She had been so sure she had not only passed both tests, but even outsmarted the proctors on the practical.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Was it because she passed out at the end of the practical? Were they upset that she actually hatched the dragon? What about the semi-taunt she remembered giving before fainting? There were too many reasons they could give for failing her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She had tried to convince herself that this other offer was something to look forward to (and she was confused they were even bothering) but she wasn’t able to keep that up for more than a few seconds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light and Velvet looked on sadly but couldn’t think of just the right words to say.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twi,” Velvet hazarded, “I know this meant a lot to you, but they did say they were preparing something just for you. I’m sure it’s something good.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Your mother’s right. It was even hoofwritten. That has to mean something.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I already know that,” Twilight whimpered. “I know. I just… I think I need to be alone for a while.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light and Velvet look to each other and sighed. Both were always surprised at how mature Twilight could be and she could handle this on her own until she was ready. The few times they had tried to force Twilight to open up early did not end well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We understand,” Velvet said, an actually understanding tone, not one resigned to the inevitable, hanging in her voice. “Just try not to cry your heart out too much.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you,” Twilight mumbled as she left for her room.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Dear Twilight Sparkle,</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I hope this letter reaches you before the one from Dean Weatherby. I should hate to cause you any undue distress. It has been well over two centuries since I have accepted a personal student but you have clearly demonstrated abilities far beyond what my school can handle and I would be honored to instruct you personally.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Ever year I see young ponies go by who could do better in a less structured environment (your brother was one of them) but the funding required for such a school would be astronomical. While I do mint the money, I am certainly not made of it. Much to my regret. However, I am going off on a tangent.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">As I was saying, should you choose to attend my school (or any other), I suspect you shall be constantly constrained by the teaching curriculum. This would, at best, frustrate you as you continued your own studies, and, at worst, destroy your potential. I would not see your talent lost to the bureaucracies needed to run a school, or a country.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">If I have erred in my opinion on your wishes, I will arrange for you to attend my school (or any other of your choice) instead should you desire. You need not be concerned for my feelings on the matter. However, I do hope you accept my offer.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">P.S. I heard you got your cutie mark during the practical exam. Congratulations!</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">P.P.S. Since you live in Canterlot, my school would not have required you to live on campus. However, due to my dense and constantly changing schedule, I would require that you live in the castle. I suspect neither of us would be satisfied or happy if I had to send for you at random times for lessons, let alone your parents. Although, from what I hear of you, I suspect this is a favor and not a request as you would be housed near the Canterlot Archives. If your parents have any objections to this, we can try to arrange something else. However, if so, you could remind them that your brother would be nearby often.</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">P.P.P.S. I doubt that this is close to your mind right now, but any choice you make will be fully funded.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well over a century?</span> <span style=" font-style:italic;">My school? C—could it be? T—This is!</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light and Velvet grew increasingly worried as Twilight read more of the letter, her face contorting in odd ways they couldn’t quite place.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both were thinking the exact same thing: <span style=" font-style:italic;">What could possibly be written in that letter and why didn’t we read it first?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Finally Twilight fainted on the spot and dropped the letter.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight!” The pair called out together.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Night Light rushed to grab Twilight. Neither were unskilled at magic, telekinesis especially, and though it would have been better to catch Twilight with magic, neither parent’s reflexes were hooked up to their magic like their daughter’s was.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still Night Light managed to catch Twilight and set her down gently, both wishing they had paid more attention in their introduction to medical magic class. Fainting isn’t hard to reverse, if you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What could possibly…” Velvet began, picking up and reading the letter.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soon after she fainted too.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This time Night Light was ready and managed to gently lower Velvet to the ground with his magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Concern lined his face.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Is the letter dangerous? I can’t notice any magic on it or any triggering when they fainted. They’re both okay, for certain definitions of okay. No noticeable ongoing spells. I guess I should take a look too.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And soon, he too fainted, with nopony to catch him.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey everypony!” Shining shouted storming through his family’s front door. “I hear my LSBFF is depressed! Well, I know just what to— Why is everypony sleeping on the floor?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shining noticed the letter and picked it up.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is this the culprit? Seems ordinary enough.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shining read the letter and laughed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you’re defeated by something like this, you’d never make it in the royal guard, much less as the vice-captain.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shining put down the letter and carried the three sleeping ponies to their beds.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Mom,” Spike began, before getting a glare from the fuming unicorn in front of him. “Err, I know you’re feeling a bit stressed—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A bit!” Twilight shouted.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, maybe really stressed. But you went overboard there.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m fed up with those bucking nobles bothering me for favors. I took the bucking archmage position to help Celestia; not so I could help the rabble with their petty games.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So just teleport them away before they get here like usual. The poor stallion didn’t deserve to be encased in solid chocolate and left in the stairwell mid-step.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight took a deep breath and exhaled while rubbing her cheeks. “You’re right Spike. I’m sorry I snapped at you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you want to talk about what’s bothering you?” Spike asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s sweet, but I don’t think a good mother should dump her problems on her son.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you want to anyways?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you going to?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine. Anyways, I have another letter for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s eye twitched. “It’s not… It’s not from my parent’s, is it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you want me to just throw it in the fire?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. I’ll read it. But if it’s more pressure to get married. I mean, she already has a grandfoal from <span style=" font-style:italic;">both</span> Shining and I.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight opened the letter and read it with superpony speed nearly on par with Celestia and burned it to ash even faster.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You know what you need after your latest foreign adventure?” Spike said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A few more chocolate covered nobles?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No,” Spike deadpanned. “You need to read a good story!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I take it you also think I would benefit from reading it aloud.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, it couldn’t hurt.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight signed and acquiesced. “Alright, Spike. I’ll read to you until your bed time. What book do you want? More grown-up dragons?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nah. I found an interesting old book in the library earlier.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really? You’re taking an interest in dusty old books now? I better watch out, the world is ending.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not a dusty old book. Just filled with old stories that have gone out of the culture.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh? That does sound interesting. Let’s see it then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight opened the book and made a quick pass through it noting the various titles and glancing at each story with the same inpony speed she regularly used.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Spike,” Twilight started, sitting down, “first, are you sure you want to hear these stories? They’re pretty far afield from your usual ones.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. Second, where exactly did you get this book, when, and why did you pick it up?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please just tell me Spike. Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ve done nothing wrong. And if you did, well, I could let it slide this time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, like I said, it was in the library. I wanted something a bit different tonight and that was stuffed in with all the other regular books and I’m sure you noticed that it’s illustrated.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes I did. Do you know if this book was normally there? Or if it was shelved differently than usual?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um, can you show me the spine?” Spike glanced at the listed code and thought for a moment. Secretly, Twilight was very proud Spike actually learned the pony-decimal system. “Yeah, now that I think about it. But not by much. Maybe a few shelves over. Why does it matter?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t worry about it Spike,” Twilight said, rubbing Spike’s head. “Now, which story do you want to hear first?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The one with the alicorns!” Spike shouted, jumping onto Twilight’s lap.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters…”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Despite being nearly the same age, Spike was still so young. Dragon’s grew much slower than ponies and Spike had only started elementary school two years ago (not that that had stopped Twilight from cramming a bunch of useful knowledge into Spike). That was why, with only an eight year age gap, Spike fell asleep barely after sunset and Twilight could be a mother for him.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was sad really. While Twilight had no intention to miss Spike growing into adulthood, she knew that she would probably have to leave that particular joy to Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, that was a far off concern and Twilight had more pressing problems as she laid Spike to bed and headed for the library.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Spike was right. A good story was just what I needed. A story that had an interesting secret. Although I have to admit, this was perhaps the most heavy hoofed piece of ancient puzzle I’ve ever seen.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When you spend most of your time pushing the boundaries of magic, digging through ancient scrolls for clues, and remembering some crystal fleetingly seen a decade ago, a pony begins to gain a certain appreciation for literature. An appreciation that allows the pony to say things like, ‘This is not the end product of a narrative that was supposed to have grown over centuries, nor is it entirely free of the things one would expect to see. Therefore, somepony had a hoof in guiding it.’ And when you together a list of everypony capable of guiding a story over centuries, well, it was a pretty short list with only one name.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I suppose I can only say I’m surprised at how unsubtle this is. I know Celestia enjoys her little games of manipulation. A gentle nudge here, a helping hoof there, and over years she can usually get the results she wants.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight would never admit it, but she did enjoy playing along. Usually.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">But this is far from her usual hooves-off approach. And a mad goddess is the last thing somepony needs to be subtle about.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Now that I think about it, I always took it for granted that calling herself a diarch meant that the people were her coruler or something. I mean, she won’t even stand to be addressed as a queen. The whole princess thing is just silly.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight entered the library, deserted at this time of night by all but the most studious unicorns from Celestia’s school. Twilight waved as she passed a few ponies she knew. Not well, but she did find tutoring enjoyable from time to time with the right pupil.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Finally Twilight reached the section of the library she actively hated.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">History Section, we meet again. What lies do you have for me today to sift through? Maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll find enough half-truths to put together what actually happened.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There’s an old saying passed down among historians in Canterlot. ‘Do not under <span style=" font-style:italic;">any</span> circumstances tell a prospective student how poorly kept ancient Equestrian history is until it’s too late.’</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was well into the morning before Twilight, even with her ludicrous reading speed, was able to piece together enough information to feel confidant enough to confront Celestia that there was, in fact, an evil, revenge-driven goddess coming to tear apart everything that was Equestria and this was no time for subtlety.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Heh. Another perk of being the archmage. Sleep is optional.</span> — Twilight nearly crashed into a bust — <span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, mostly optional. Perhaps I should at least take a nap. It’s been a while.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight awoke after a series of strange, stress-induced dreams (a regular thing after an extended trip on archmage duties) to the setting sun after considerably more than her intended nap.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">On the floor below she could hear Spike making supper. From the sound of it, he was roasting something with his own fire despite Twilight telling him not to do that at least a hundred times. Although, there was the special condition that if he was ever cooking at Prince Blueblood’s then he both was permitted, and should.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight rolled out of her bed and fell on her hooves. Heading downstairs, she found Spike holding an incriminatingly smoking meal on a stick.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You know what, Spike? I’m not in the mood to deal with this so you’re off the hook if you give me one of those.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike held out one of the vegetarian skewers, that is, one lacking any gemstones and therefore actually fit for pony consumption, while idly staring at the ground. Twilight grabbed the skewer and wolfed down the contents.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Spike, I have some business to take care of today. I mean tonight. Will you be okay on your own, and the tower not in any way on fire, or should I teleport you to your grandparents?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll be alright.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s a promise, alright. I’ll hold you to it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I promise I’ll behave.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good. I probably won’t be back before you fall asleep, so goodnight, Spike.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And good morning to you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight left her tower for Celestia’s chambers nearly directly downstairs. Lots of stairs.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is Princess Celestia in?” Twilight inquired of a guard.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not at this time, Archmage Twilight. She is currently indisposed but will return shortly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Very well, I shall wait inside then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight entered the room and sat down on the clouds in the center of the room that Celestia was fond of using for her bed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Someday I really need to have a talk with her about getting some more chairs in here. Even I have a guest chair.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia had told Twilight when she was still a filly on one of the many occasions they slept together, that the cloud-walking spell could not do a cloud bed justice as Pegasus magic could. Twilight was rather skeptical. Even now, much older and freshly out of bed she almost wanted to drift back to sleep.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nearly nodding off, Twilight heard the doors open and snapped to attention. It was hard to put on a proper level of indignity when you were caught falling asleep.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight, what brings you here so late? If you want to spend the night, you should bring Spike with you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m not a filly anymore, Celestia.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, but it would be fun. Your so cute when you are asleep.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight face-hoofed. A habit she had developed years ago. One of which she could never rid herself.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Look, I’ll just get to why I’m here. I know our friendship has limits, however high or low they may be, and that you have your secrets. Lots of them. I respect that. But <span style=" font-style:italic;">this</span>” — Twilight hovered the book Spike picked up open to the illustration showing Celestia and Luna — “is something else. I know you enjoy playing long games with ponies, and I admit I have tried my hoof at them as well, but in this case you are being, quite frankly, irresponsible.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A returning goddess, that wants nothing more than to kill you is bad enough. Worse, you saw fit to banish her to the moon for a thousand years. I don’t know how well alicorns handle solitary confinement, but even the most introverted individuals can’t take it for too long. That’s why it’s used as a short term punishment. Either Luna, or Nightmare Moon as she calls herself now, will come back broken, or stable-like by holding onto something — like revenge — with single-minded devotion. My bet is on the former.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Even with super effective magical artifacts like the elements of harmony, which I might add we do not have, I don’t know if there will be anything <span style=" font-style:italic;">left</span> to revert to after that kind of torture.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Worse, from what I gather, Nightmare Moon is more powerful than you are and you only won with a surprise attack using the elements. When fights reach your level of power, or even mine, they are almost always decided by researching your opponent’s defenses beforehoof and launching a surprise attack. So then, what <span style=" font-style:italic;">is</span> your plan. Because if it’s leave a book out-of-place in the library and hope your archmage sorts it all out blindly, you better prepare for banishment to the sun or worse.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh buck. That came out far harsher than I wanted. And she’s frowning. I’ve never even seen her frown. Good work, Twilight.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight, first calm down. You seem to be over-stressed and ready to lash out at anypony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Celestia said that, Twilight realized that she was awfully close to ripping the library book apart with magic and puncturing the cloud she rested on with her hooves. Taking a few deep breaths to calm down, Twilight relaxed her muscles and set the book down on the floor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sorry. It will only sound like an excuse, but I’ve been rather busy with things I do <span style=" font-style:italic;">not</span> enjoy lately.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I understand. There are plenty of days I want to demolish this castle and let the foalish politicians run Equestria into the ground on their own. The important thing is to remember not to do it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So,” Celestia said, sitting down, “let us start with that book. I honestly have not seen that book in… Well, I can not seem to remember, but it has been decades at the least.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You didn’t deliberately miss-shelf this book to get Spike to find it and bring it to my attention? Because that is totally in character for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nay. I have laid other plans that are, as you say, in character for me, but this is certainly not one of them. As for the matter with…my sister. I really do not know what to do.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re kidding me. I’m sorry, but a thousand years wasn’t long enough to think of something?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Think about it. As you said, Luna is stronger than me. In her folly, she has performed many foolish actions that grew her power significantly beyond my own without aid from the elements. I can not hope to achieve anything through brute force.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“At the end of her banishment, she will be totally unprotected as she reappears in the world, but banishment spells are resistible and if I were to cast one on her it would fail. I can not kill her, and even if I had the ability, I am sure that I would not at the moment of truth.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then as you said, the banishment has probably…” Celestia sniffed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Celestia sniffed? Did she really just do that?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The banishment has probably broken her in one way or another. I couldn’t talk her down before, and she’s probably only more set in her folly now. Or something worse. There is a kind of madness that grew in her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There was a spell we missed from an old battle. It works in subtle ways. A stray thought you think is your own once and a while. Ones that lead you down a dark path over decades. By the time it wore off, it was too late. She’s not blameless, b—but still…to my dearest sister…I…I—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight embraced her friend in a tight hug, comforting Celestia for the first time instead of Celestia comforting her. That was all the princess needed to fall apart and really start crying.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Some time later, Twilight asked, “What about the elements? Do you think they have any chance of working?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If we had them at f—f—full strength, maybe.” Celestia recovered slightly and continued, “Until a few decades ago, the elements were mere husks of what they once were. They were…about as unhappy with how I used them as I was using them to banish Luna.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So they are at least around somewhere?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes. But they still don’t want me anywhere near them. I tried once and they— I guess you could say they burned my magic as I tried to pick them up. I have not had many ponies I can trust with them, and only you recently, so I have let them lie in the old castle under the guard of my own spells.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do I need to ask the obvious?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. You are…singularly unsuitable for recovering them. I did not want to bother you with my problems knowing that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you going to elaborate on that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The elements can be used without six ponies. Obviously you know Luna and I used them effectively alone and I managed all six, if poorly. But they are best used in a group of six. And anything less than that, probably wouldn’t be able to save Luna.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So what’s the catch?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Close friendships are needed between the six bearers, each of which needs to embody the trait they wield.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is that all?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight, you are extraordinarily introverted. Ask yourself how many friends you have, right now, after 22 years.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…I see your point. I’m sure there are other powerful mages for the element of magic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There are plenty, although universally much older. Most are similar to you, if not as extreme, in their introversion. Worse, they all have an insatiable thirst for power.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And I don’t?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia managed a chuckle. “You’re a special case. Should you gain power equivalent to an alicorn, or even beyond, I could trust you with it. Anyways, each element gives a, shall we say, thematically appropriate set of passive abilities to an appropriate bearer. The element of magic has particularly troublesome advantages that I would not see misused.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, give me some time to absorb all this information.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight and Celestia sat in silence, broken by the occasional sniffle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">So, Celestia has had one thousand years to think of solutions. Any potential solution I come up with must hinge upon recent, for certain definitions of recent, information that she wouldn’t have had time to dwell on or things I can change about myself.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Absolute worst case scenario, I can permanently sacrifice my research’s power source. And ruin my life. That’s more of a save my life solution though, so it bears no further thought.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">The only viable solution seems to be recovering the elements and utilizing their full power. Celestia says nopony is suitable to wield the element of magic and that seems to be the the crux of the issue. The other five elements seem to be non-issues except in that they must be friendly with the element of magic.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Any sufficiently powerful mage will take the threat of Nightmare Moon seriously and will try to adjust their behavior to complete the mission, myself included, regardless of what they will do after it is done.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Celestia is unwilling, but probably not unconvincible, to let somepony other than myself use the element of magic. She is incapable herself because the elements…hold a grudge. Am I significantly more introverted than anypony else that I guarantee failure more than another? That seems unlikely, but troubling given Celestia is concerned.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Any behavior altering spells will probably upset the elements if we try to use them to make friends. Note to self: Determine if the elements prevent magic from negatively altering the mind. That would be useful. The elements also require ‘deep’ friendships. I doubt time matters, but a friendship made for the sake of friendship certainly wouldn’t work.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This…seems pretty bleak.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Alright, let’s continue to assume this is solvable. The real problem seems to be I am not suited for making friends. This is true, but perhaps we can get results if we resort to drastic methods. Note to self: Do not think about ‘taking drastic measures’ when making friends or the elements will probably hate me.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">More and more, I really want to study these elements. Celestia seems to be suggesting they’re sentient and have a persistent memory across the ages. That…doesn’t seem right. Unless the elements are an extension of some other larger device. Hmm. Wait. Rampaging goddess. That’s more important.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">So, friends. It’s clear I can’t make friends in Canterlot, or anywhere with a similar pony base, or I would have already. I’ve met other powerful mages and we don’t exactly click. We see each other as peers, but we are too used to being alone to really connect. Telling them we need to be friends to save the world will have an opposite effect because we’ll always know that our friendship is superficial and constructed from need. I’ll have to look to crowds I rarely interact with and hope we get lucky.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I </span>know<span style=" font-style:italic;"> that I can’t make friends that are — well, I can’t find a tactful way to say it — stupid. I’m not asking for genius, but at least some driving passion in which they excel. The base rate of this…is troubling. Further adding the restriction that they can ‘embody’ an element is asking for the impossible. Unless the elements are less picky about what ‘embodying’ them means than I think.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Ugh…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">We have about a month before the solstice and Nightmare Moon is freed. If only I had more time. Did Star Swirl leave behind some research about that? There were a couple spells I couldn’t understand. No. They had the wrong structure for a time spell. Probably.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Celestia, a quick question. Do you know any spells to give us more time? Regardless of risk.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia shook her head.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">So, we have just a month.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Another quick question. How picky are the elements about ‘embodying’ a trait?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not too much, with the exception of the element of magic. For example, take honesty. An effective bearer can lie. Perhaps the bearer is even skilled at lying. The key thing is a strongly internalized preference for truth over lies. Being honest because honesty is the best choice, or because it is the moral norm is not enough, but it is close.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That makes things slightly easier.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Also, do relationships not typically considered friendship work?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“As long as the ties run deep among the entire group, I would guess yes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh. Right. The group. I can’t just cobble together random ponies. Everyone has to like each other. It would be easiest to integrate into an existing social…group…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight face-hoofed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Shining, Cadance, Mom, Dad, and Spike are a solid set of five all already friendly with each other and myself. The only problem is none of them really seem to have a strong preference for an element over its opposite. Maybe Cadance with kindness, but I think that’s more of function of her obsession with love. Shining is certainly loyal to his country, but it’s not called the element of honorable fealty.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Urgh. These elements are stupid. They are all essentially positive behavioral traits that you could see in almost anypony. I might as well just trot around town with the elements, see if one of them likes somepony, and then proceed to acquire a friend.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Let’s put the family circle on hold for now. It’s a good backup plan. Where can I find a large group of close knit ponies that I can pluck out five random element bearers and expect them to already be friends?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Wait, that’s obvious. A small town where everypony knows everypony. But large enough that introducing myself will be see as positive. The closest such town to the old castle would be…Appleloosa?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No, Ponyville is closer on the other side of the Everfree. They’ll certainly be different from the ponies around here. I might be able to tolerate, or even enjoy the company of five random ponies sporting a wildly different culture. At least for long enough to be friends when Nightmare Moon arrives.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Celestia, sorry about this, but you’ll have to manage all my duties by yourself for the next month.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have an idea?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep. I’m going to take a month long vacation. I’m thinking, Ponyville. I’m pretty stressed right now and something completely different might be surprisingly comforting. We could even have the Summer Sun Celebration there this year.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you sure you want to do this, Twilight?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m pretty sure I don’t, but it’s better than no plan. Or a plan we know will fail. And I really could use a vacation. Even if it’s just a pretend one.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Very well. But you’re going to be overseeing the celebration.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fair enough. It’ll be a good cover too. I can have a legitimate reason to be there to present to the townsfolk.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight got up and moved to leave, but then stopped after remembering she had dredged up bad memories in Celestia. “I actually just woke up a couple hours ago. I know you were joking before, but if you want me to stay until you fall asleep, I can.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll be alright, Twilight. Thank you though. It means a lot to me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good night then,” Twilight said, making for the door. “Try to have some sweet dreams.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When the doors shut and Twilight had reached the edge of the teleportation block around Celestia’s room, Twilight’s horn glowed, and she disappeared.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was nearly midnight when Twilight appeared high in the sky above an anonymous section of apartments in Manehattan. She had looked up this address semi-legally years ago but never worked up the courage to barge in. Today, however, she had come to ask a favor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight performed a short, accurate teleport to just outside room 417. Stopping just short of knocking, Twilight froze.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What if she doesn’t remember me? Or want to see me? Or help? I really don’t want to pull rank. I should have done this years ago, and yet here I am, scared like an idiot just like every time I tried before. I </span>have<span style=" font-style:italic;"> to do this. Backup plans are too important.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight forced herself to knock timidly, then again normally. Twilight was about to knock again when she heard a small crash and a voice said, “Oh, horseapples. Just a second!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A lime green unicorn opened the door. “Hello.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hello, Daisy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not to be rude, but I can’t quite seem to remember you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s not terribly surprising. Well, maybe a bit. You must not read any newspapers. Anyways, we only met once, eighteen years ago.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wow, that’s a long time. You would have been just a filly. Can I get a hint?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Canterlot Summer Sun Celebration.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm…” — Daisy crossed her arms and closed her eyes for a good minute. — “Oh! Twilight Sparkle? You’ve certainly grown, not that I expected you to stay small. This is quite a surprise. I can barely believe you remember me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I never forgot. You were my first mentor.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I just gave you a little advice.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Maybe, but it was well timed. My life would have been very different without it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, come on it and let’s talk,” Daisy said, opening the door wide and gesturing towards her living room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Actually, I was hoping I could take you somewhere, if you don’t mind going out this late. You won’t need anything. It will be worth the trip.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. So where are we going?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight held out a hoof and said, “Pretty far. Just hold tight. You may get disoriented and I wouldn’t want you to fall.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy grasped Twilight’s hoof and Twilight transported the two of them across Equestria with a series of jumps.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excuse me,” Daisy said, “What?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We teleported.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know that, but how many times?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sixty-three. Roughly the optimal number for speed and accuracy between here and Manehattan for me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And…where is here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Just outside the Canterlot Castle’s kitchen. They take special orders at any time, day or night. The royal brew of coffee here is delicious and has gotten me through more nights than I care to count. Everything else is excellent as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy stood stunned, halfway through the kitchen door. “That…is impressive. Not many unicorns can teleport, and that distance is just…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m glad I can still shock somepony. Nopony ever seems to notice anymore.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So you’re working at the castle then?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And then I suppose you got into Princess Celestia’s school. Congratulations! You’ve done really well for yourself. I hope you’re giving yourself the credit and not thinking I’m the reason you’re doing so well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight ordered a coffee for herself and Daisy asked for the same. The pair then sat down with their drinks in the dinning hall.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I do give you a lot of credit. Practices developed during the formative years of a pony’s life are important. But I did work hard myself too,” Twilight grinned. “However, you’re wrong about Celestia’s school. I was rejected.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What!” Daisy exclaimed, nearly spewing out her coffee with comedic effect.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s what I thought at first too. But a few days after receiving my rejection letter I got a letter from Celestia asking if I would be her personal student.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For a second time, Daisy was stunned.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m two for two, and on a roll,” said Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Recovering, Daisy asked, “What did you do to warrant that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I broke the exams. The practical that year was to hatch a dragon egg. I was particularly skilled at spell analysis, composition, and decomposition, thanks to your advice although I won’t get into the details why, and noticed that the exam was actually testing something else. Probably creativity, or raw power or something like that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, I noticed the egg was protected from actually hatching. Poorly.” Timing her next words just as Daisy took a drink, Twilight continued, “And well, I was probably the youngest mare to ever become a mother at the tender age of eight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This time Daisy did spit out her coffee in exactly the comedic style Twilight was hoping for, and had a spell ready to defend against.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, that’s got to be worth at least two points.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um…when you say mother…did you raise the dragon?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, and no. Yes, I am currently raising him. No, in that dragons grow a lot slower and I was much older before I actually took over the responsibility. In actuality, the situation is more along the lines of a teenage pregnancy. It took a lot of getting used to, but it’s been pretty fun.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, in between spellcasting and raising a dragon, what is it that you do here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, when Celestia felt I was old enough to unleash me on the world, I had two options, more or less. I could seclude myself on a mountain somewhere, stopping by occasionally to chat and trade research materials. There are days I almost regret not choosing that. The other option was to accept the position of archmage.” Twilight paused looking expectant. “You don’t seem surprised. Is it just not as much in comparison?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, I am surprised. I’m just not letting you score more points.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight broke out laughing and soon Daisy joined in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, dear,” Twilight wheezed. “This is just what I needed. Being the archmage is such a stressful job.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So then. I assume you had some reason to come knocking on my door after all these years?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Back to work,” Twilight sighed. “Yes. Two actually. First, I’ve always wanted to be friends but was worried you wouldn’t or wouldn’t remember me. And admittedly, recent events have forced me to have additional ulterior motives for that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Second is…well, the second reason is probably better off kept secret. Basically, my hoof is being forced and I have to spend over a month away from the castle and my job. And, well, I need somepony to help Celestia with the work I’m dumping on her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And you want me to do it? Twilight, I’ve never held a government position in my life.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s a point in your favor actually.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Look, before we get to the practical difficulties, why me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Many reasons. Celestia has nopony capable <span style=" font-style:italic;">and</span> trustworthy to fill my position while I’m gone. She’s far too busy to manage my work in addition to her own alone. As far as I can tell, you’re smart, and not just academic smart. You probably won’t just do what you’re told. You graduated from Celestia’s school so she knows who you are. Yes that’s true. Celestia remembers every pony that goes through the school. Even the rejected applications. You have no important political affiliations. Your foals are all grown and have moved out. You own your own business and can let the employees manage it for a while. I could go on but I’m sure you get the picture. Most importantly, I’m willing to trust you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy gave Twilight another point and said, “That’s extremely flattering.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You did ask. I could tell you about your negative aspects but they are fairly petty in comparison to your virtues.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I hate to ask for favors when I’m the mare that just yesterday covered a noble looking for one in solid chocolate and left him to melt free, but I have few choices. I can’t give you the world in gratitude, but I can promise pretty much anything else. Not to mention you’d get all the perks associated with my office. Like royal coffee. And cloud beds. So, thoughts?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy sat drinking her coffee absentmindedly, even after she had run out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Do you really have a cloud bed?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll sleep on the offer, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight smiled and replied, “Not at all. I only woke up…four hours ago now. I’ll be up all night.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike woke up a little after dawn broke and noticed that Twilight was already in bed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s odd. She only woke up, what, ten hours ago? That’s like thirty hours early.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike shrugged and headed downstairs to the kitchen. If he had any complaints about his mother, she was the worst cook in the world. Spike couldn’t really complain though, considering the castle’s kitchen would cook literally anything, anytime, for his mother or for him.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Mom doesn’t understand the quality of a home-flamed gemstone dinner. And those fools downstairs can’t serve a gem encrusted dish to save their lives. I guess they don’t really know what it’s supposed to taste like, being ponies. But my point still stands.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Anyways, the walls are made of stone, and the books are protected with magic. It’s not like roasting things is really dangerous. She should just let me cook properly.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike grumbled through making breakfast for himself, as well as a bit that either he or Twilight could eat, should she wake up early.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike ate his breakfast in silence, thinking about what to do with his vacation today.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Mom’s probably busy with that book. I wish she would have just told me what was so important about it.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A sound of hoofsteps came from the stairs and Spike rushed to greet Twilight with a morning hug. From where his face was against Twilight, Spike noticed her coat had changed color.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Momma, what happened? Your coat is green.” Spike let go and backed off to get a better look. “Huh? Who are you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You must be Spike. I can see why Twilight enjoyed raising you. You’re so cute and affectionate.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia rose late at night everyday to raise the sun, and Twilight was planning to wait until sunset to sleep. This is how the pair came to be holding a long conversation planning the details of Twilight’s ‘vacation’, what part Celestia was to play, which of Twilight’s duties actually <span style=" font-style:italic;">needed</span> addressing in her absence, and the Summer Sun Celebration.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">However, the guards knew none of this and looked on from a distance curiously, wondering what possible reason the notoriously late sleeper — although some say she only pretends to sleep to have privacy — of an archmage could have for being awake at this hour.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As they stood, guarding not quite as effectively as a non-confused guard, they were further troubled by the approach of the archmage’s…well they just referred to him as the archmage’s colt and left it at that lest they start remembering the fires of his younger years.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike alone was nothing to be surprised at, as often as he wandered the castle. However, he had a unicorn with him that none of the guards recognized. It was standard operating procedure that anypony that a guard could not recognize, outside of when open court was held (and then requiring a visitor’s identification), was an intruder.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But this unicorn was with the archmage’s colt. Surely that meant she was the archmage’s guest. Right?</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Err…halt?” A guard hesitantly demanded, risking the ire of the archmage. “Identify yourself. Please.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Daisy exchanged confused glances.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My name is Daisy Wishes,” Daisy replied. Then whispering to Spike, added, “Are guards always this polite?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No,” Spike whispered back. “They’re probably still a little nervous around me from my early years when I couldn’t control my fire breath.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What is your purpose in Canterlot Castle?” The guard asked after Spike had finished whispering. It wouldn’t due to be rude. Just in case.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Visiting Twilight Sparkle at the moment. And I guess business as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The guards felt a bit more nervous now, having confirmation of her ‘guest of the archmage’ status. The guard that had spoken nodded to another who promptly left through the door to which lead to the room in which the archmage and princess were conversing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We are announcing your presence. Please await on her majesty’s and her excellency’s pleasure.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A moment of awkward looks were exchanged before the guard returned.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Whispering into the de facto leader’s ear, the guard reported.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Her majesty and her excellency will see you now. They are through this door, down the hall, second door on the left.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you,” Daisy said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Daisy walked through the door, the guards all gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After the doors closed behind her, Daisy turned to Spike again, and asked, “Was I supposed to do anything else?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t really know. Momma just sort of runs around and ponies move out of her way. I more or less get the same attitude by extension.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds awfully convenient,” Daisy replied as they entered the hallway.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But a bit lonely.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose so.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not that she ever cares.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. Outside of her family, I think the princess is her only friend. Err…besides you that is.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh. I guess it’s lonely at the top of the government.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“From what I gather, it’s actually a persistent problem across her whole life.” Spike quickly added, “Please don’t tell her I said that. She doesn’t think it’s a problem at all. Neither does Princess Celestia, I think.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I promise I won’t.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks,” Spike said, knocking on the second door on the left.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s voice called out, “Come in!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The room Spike and Daisy entered was small and inelegantly furnished. There were no windows, nor were there any other doors but the thick ones behind them. The presence of warding spells permeated the room and Daisy wondered how she could have missed such dense magic on just the other side of the doors. A small, round table was laid in the center of the room ringed by chairs as uninteresting, but seemingly comfortable, as the room. Decorating two of the chairs were Twilight Sparkle and Princess Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the presence of Princess Celestia, who she had only been so close to on her graduation day, Daisy was nearly overwhelmed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">How does Twilight talk so casually about her? And she’s her friend? I didn’t think about it before, but…oh my gosh I’m just standing here awkwardly.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It is a very great pleasure to be in your presence again, your majesty,” Daisy blurted out, beginning to bow.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No need for the formalities,” Celestia replied. “They are so very tiring and we are in private.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Y—yes,” Daisy responded, nearly falling over from her aborted half-bow.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now, you said again. Where is it that we have met before?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Graduation,” Twilight coughed. “Twenty-eight years ago.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, yes. Daisy Wishes, right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, princess.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sorry for not recognizing you at first. Not to be rude, but you have grown a lot older.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No problem at all, princess.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You do not have to add ‘princess’ at the end of every sentence.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, princess. Thank you, princess,” Daisy said, entirely not taking the request to heart. Twilight snickered. “Err…I mean. Thank you. If I may ask, what is this room?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Chambers of the Privy Council™,” Twilight replied.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose this is a minor detail, but what was that? Did I just… Did I hear trademark in that sentence?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sort of.” Celestia began explaining, “It is the result of a joke spell I created centuries ago. Twilight heard it once and begged for days for me to teach it to her. She put the enchantment on no less than four phrases before I told her to stop.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy looked to Twilight who was somehow looking both ashamed and proud of her work.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My own casting of the spell was on the phrase The Horded Lore of Celestia Herself™. I was…a younger pony back then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not that young,” Twilight mumbled, just loud enough for everypony to hear.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia casually pushed Twilight off balance with magic, almost resulting in Twilight falling to the ground. Daisy couldn’t help but laugh at the pair, even being in front of her quite imposing princess, the ruler of Equestria.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now that we have broken the ice,” Celestia began, “we should get down to business. Twilight has told me she intends to have you be her replacement, if in a limited sense, while she is attending to a rather prolonged mission. Are you willing to accept her request?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t think I am capable enough to do it, but I can try if both of you insist. Though I would like to know exactly what I would be doing before I commit to it, if I could.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No problem,” Twilight said. “I don’t leave for two days, although officially I leave tomorrow so do not tell anypony that, so we can spend today together and have you observe me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And what if I decide not to take the job? What will you do then?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That choice is entirely yours to make,” Celestia answered. “We will not force this on you, for most likely it will be difficult and stressful even with my assistance. If you choose not to stay, I shall simply have to do the work myself, which I assure you I am quite capable of managing should I need to.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Although, on a personal level, I am quite eager to spend time with the pony the infamous introvert, Twilight Sparkle, wants to be friends with.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh dear Celestia! Princess Celestia wants to spend time with </span>me<span style=" font-style:italic;">!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">“</span>By extension”, came the little voice of self-non-delusion, currently far from in control.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy resisted the urge to shout ‘I’ll do it,’ and instead calmly said, “Alright, I’ll take the job.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excellent,” both Twilight and Celestia said at the same time.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had spent the rest of the day with Daisy following her around, answering her questions as they came, and laughing inside at everypony’s shocked expression when Twilight went by talking happily with Daisy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Just after sunset, the two mares retreated to Twilight’s room with a teleport to spare Daisy the climb. Daisy collapsed on Twilight’s bed, still wearing the cloud-walking bracelet Twilight had given her last night.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So. What did you think of today?” Twilight asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That was the most walking I’ve ever done in a single day. How do you manage that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I admit my hooves are pretty sore as well. I usually teleport everywhere in the castle when I’m this busy, but I felt you should have the full experience of what you’re getting into. The work should be easier after a couple days. I was out of Canterlot for a few days before I visited you and work always piles up. You’d think being out on official business would excuse me of regular business.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Can you teach me to teleport?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, but not in the time I have available.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Couldn’t you just teleport back and forth between wherever you’re going and here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I could but unfortunately it would be a bad idea. I am going to be doing…well, work that requires that I keep up a normal schedule and especially not mysteriously disappear in the middle of the night. Or the day. However, when I come back I’d be glad to do so.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose that would still be helpful.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But you should know, there are some practical problems to teleporting within the castle, among many other places in the world. The castle has a large teleportation block on it. You can only teleport into, within, or out of it if you put an extra magical signature into your spell. I would give it to you, but you’re not a combat mage so it would put you at risk. There are also spots where teleporting is simply blocked out altogether. The council room is one, as is Celestia’s room.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But not yours I see.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. I must admit the idea of climbing those stairs several times a day horrifies me. I’ll generally go both ways once in a day, but no more than that. I’ll take a very small security flaw over so many stairs any day.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You could just fly up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Actually, no. When I took up the position of archmage, there was a lot of security spells placed on the castle, but there were some glaring flaws. Among several other patches, I made sure to place a temporary enchantment to ground everypony without wings. It takes a long time to put up permanent, detailed spells and that one is low on my list of priorities to upgrade from temporary status. Any other thoughts?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You mentioned at some point that if anypony asks me to do something not already approved, I was well within my right to tell them to ‘sod off’. I can guess why, but are there any particular reasons or ponies to be wary of?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Literally anypony that introduces himself or herself as a noble. They don’t leave me alone despite…measures taken to make them. I doubt they would miss an opportunity to extract promises from you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And if I accidentally make any?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t. Make promises if you think it’s a good idea or the right thing to do. Just don’t do it accidentally. If you get into any real trouble, just talk to Celestia. She’ll bail you out.” Twilight quickly added, “And won’t think any less of you for it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy nodded and snuggled deeper into the bed, dangerously close to drifting off to sleep.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do ponies ever go to sleep on a cloud bed and never wake up?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why do you think ponies often consider pegasii the laziest type of pony? The cloud bed is a dangerous weapon, capable of toppling mighty empires.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Mm. Consider me toppled.” The mares shared a good laugh. “Can you ferry me home tomorrow? I need to make sure nopony thinks I’ve been foalnapped and arrange matters at my pastries shop.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course. If you don’t mind, I think I’d like to eat breakfast there as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t think it can compare to the palace kitchens.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not at all. The food certainly is good here, but they always go overboard. Often, I just want a regular donut, or a simple strudel.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you insist. Just be prepared to be disappointed.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Actually, I’ve been there before,” Twilight said, bashfully rubbing her hoof in circles on the floor. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you for years, and…I lost my nerve each time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll try not to think too deeply on that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That would probably be for the best. But anyways, you know a bit about my life. Let’s talk about yours. You’ve got to have some interesting stories to tell. The dossier I totally, legally obtained on your location was unmindful of the details.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I guess I do have a few…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yay!” Twilight jumped from her chair, and added, “Just a second.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight disappeared for a few seconds and returned with Spike.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, go ahead,” Twilight said, eyes filled with foal-like expectation.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy laughed at the the absurdity of the situation. The Archmage of Equestria was sitting across from her, waiting more impatiently than dragon that was the actual foal present for what amounted to bedtime stories.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How did my life get to this,” Daisy said to herself before addressing Twilight and Spike. “Okay, so this happened back when I was at Princess Celestia’s school—”</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">I am not going to attempt writing a consistent country accent into the Apple family (although I won’t be ignoring vocabulary choices). At some future point I may revise the story to include such accents. I still have no clue how <span style=" font-style:italic;">only</span> that family managed to get that accent.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Also, I have no idea where the idea of psychopathic seaponies originated from. My best guess is the story MLP Time Loops (which is very good and worth reading) by Saphroneth and several other authors.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">The world shook.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The Everfree Forest was a terrible place, and agreed to be the most dangerous location in Equestria. The forest’s edge had been tamed by ponies desperately trying to prevent the forest from expanding, but the depths grew wild and unchecked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">All manner of dangerous plants grew within the Everfree, and as if in testament to them, the forest was the last place in Equestria where carnivores could feed without fear of reprisal.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">An aged, brick path lead from the outskirts to the heart of the forest where the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters endured. The road was useless now, a thousand years after it was last used, except to guide lonely travelers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">All manner of brambles and grasses had infiltrated the stones, yet lingering magic prevented trees from growing, granting passage, if not safe passage, for the archmage of Equestria on her visit to the Everfree.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Permeating the forest was a chaotic magic field, interrupting or interfering with most spells, including teleportation. Those brave enough to attempt such a spell were lucky if nothing happened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The passive aura of the elements of harmony could create a small area of order, but the castle in which they were stored had been locked down with every manner of ancient spell by Celestia centuries ago. There were no quick ways in, or out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had been careful to arrange her sojourn in the forest during midday when most of the creatures living in the forest would be slumbering, likely with a freshly filled stomach. Even Twilight Sparkle, the most celebrated mage known since Star Swirl the Bearded, feared the forest, for here, her magic was at its weakest and there were things better left undisturbed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Over hills, across rivers, and above gaping chasms Twilight traveled, until finally reaching the old castle.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This was a place of great wonder. And now, it lies in ruins. Even now, the architecture is beautiful. What I would give to have seen it in its prime.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Breaking her gaze from the crumbling castle, Twilight started her cautious journey into the wards surrounding it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was careful to follow Celestia’s instructions exactly to avoid setting off any of the wards that had been placed on the castle. She made specific motions, took specific paths, and at all times radiated a magical signature indicating a friend.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Some of the broken castle caused difficulties and one doorway, long deprived of a door, was blocked, forcing Twilight to use a much longer alternative path. However, to Twilight’s relief, with each step closer to the throne room she took, Twilight could feel the presence of the chaotic magic of the forest recede a bit more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Finally, Twilight reached the throne room. It was perhaps the best preserved space in the castle, owing to the elements of harmony resting within it. Debris still lined the floor, the windows broken, doors long past or oxidized, but the structural integrity of the hall was in no way compromised.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The elements of harmony were housed in a giant structure, clearly not part of the original layout, in the center of the room. This was where Celestia had laid the vast majority of her traps, catching anypony fortunate enough to make it to the throne room, and greedy enough to misuse the elements. It was faint, but hidden behind the calming effects of the elements, she could feel Celestia’s hostile magic waiting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The way to pass through was simple enough. Merely some words to be spoken. But those words were lost to the ages for everypony but Twilight and Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dear sister, Luna Ezell Satilus, please forgive me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With the words spoken, the niggling sense of hostility in the air retreated and greeted Twilight as a friend, enveloping her in its protection.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That password is not a good sign. I can only imagine what a thousand years of guilt has done to Celestia. I really hope she doesn’t do anything…unhelpful when Nightmare Moon returns.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight set about gathering the elements, one by one, saving the element of magic for last. Each element was encased in a dull colored, protective sphere that Twilight could not penetrate, at least not without further testing far from the Everfree Forest. Twilight labeled each element before sticking it in her magic portable pocket for safekeeping. Small glass-like openings let Twilight see inside each sphere.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Hmm…a golden necklace in each one. Oh, hello there, Generosity. Thanks for the better view. Some kind of dull, gray gem. It could be because it’s not shiny so nopony cares, but I’ve never seen anything like it before. I guess that makes sense. Celestia did say the element should reflect the last appropriate bearer and its been ‘sleeping’ so it probably needs to imprint on somepony.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Now let’s take a look at that magic element.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Argh!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Twilight touched the element of magic a light nearly as bright as the sun emitted from it. Twilight shielded her eyes and when she looked again the element of magic, a tiara with six-pointed star shaped gems encrusted in it, was lying where the sphere had once been.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Huh. Tiara. Unexpected. Why is Magic different from the others? This is going to be an itch I can’t scratch for a month. Also, Note to Self: Do not test for elemental bearerness in public or anywhere with windows without wards.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight levitated the element of magic onto her head. Immediately she felt its effects flow through her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well this is impressive. A rough guess would say this is increasing my magical power by an order of magnitude. I wonder what else it can do— No, Twilight. You have an evil goddess coming. Just ask Celestia for details and experiment later.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight left the castle as carefully as she had come, in case not all the wards were friendly to her. Celestia hadn’t said either way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Leaving the castle and walking out into the forest, Twilight couldn’t feel the chaos and disorder that had plagued her on the walk to the castle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">As expected, the elements are ordering the forest’s magic around me. I can probably teleport out like this. Do I dare? It would be pretty embarrassing to die right here.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight fired off a series of successively more complicated spells and found that each one worked properly until reaching a defining border of stability where the more complex ones failed spectacularly. Next she successfully teleported a nearby brick just inside the border. Finally she teleported another adjacent brick to significantly outside the border and saw it was no worse for the journey.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Alright then. Let’s get out of this infernal forest.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight appeared in her room at the top of the tower. She had already moved Spike to Cadance’s and Shining’s house where he would stay for the next month, so she was alone. At first, Spike had tried to pressure Twilight to let him come with but relented when he was reminded that he would get to have a month long sleepover with Star Charmer.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight sent off a message spell to inform Celestia of her return. Twilight pulled a bit of her research she had packed into her portable pocket. No sense in wasting the time after all.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">About an hour later, she had a pile of calculations twenty pages deep. As Twilight was jotting down another note, Celestia nudged her. Surprised, Twilight jumped from her chair.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I swear, Twilight,” Celestia began, hoof on her forehead, “someday one of your enemies shall take advantage of your research trances. You <span style=" font-style:italic;">need</span> to work on that when you’re working outside the castle.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, come now. I’m careful. Usually. Besides, none of my enemies really want to deal with an angry alicorn.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I guess that is true.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight turned to Daisy who stood behind Celestia, already looking tired from today’s work. “I see you’ve been working hard. Remember, I was never here today.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Understood. Can I ask what the tiara is for?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm. It’s not right to call it a MacGuffin, but I can certainly call it a quest item. If I understand correctly, it’s basically pure good made manifest. For certain definitions of good. Sort of like a Phoenix.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Am I allowed to know about this?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t see what not. You could find information about it in several out-of-print books for foals. Also, have fun with it, for I lend it to you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight floated the tiara over to Daisy and placed it on her head. A sense of loss pervaded her beyond the mere diminishing of her magic. Yet she could still feel the presence of the element somehow within her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wha? But, this feels…” — Daisy turned to Celestia — “I can’t keep this! This—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia put a hoof to Daisy’s mouth to quiet her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am afraid you must. The elements of harmony…do not like me, and we shall need it to place spells in the Everfree Forest.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy paled, “The Everfree…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do not worry. I shall be there with you. Few creatures of the forest would dare attack with me present, and the element on your head will let us cast spells freely, including teleportation apparently considering how early Twilight returned.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight interrupted, “Sorry to cut you off, but we all have places to be. Before I leave, I have two things to say.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“First, expect a one-minute visit from me tomorrow exactly at midnight to pick up details about how the elements work. I will, of course, arrive here in my room. You can leave the information with Daisy if you wish.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Second, I will require that back soon to practice using it. Please do what needs to be done soon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And with that, I will take my leave.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight disappeared taking the papers she had scattered about with her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia turned to Daisy, saying, “We should get going as well, lest we become missed.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy nodded preparing for another disorienting teleport, still not acclimated to them. “Is she always so—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Blunt? Expedient? Careless? Yes.” A barely audible sigh came from Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now, we shall need to pay a quick visit to the depths of the royal vault to hide that tiara.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia promptly teleported the two of them and once more the room was empty.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight next appeared outside the house of her brother Shining and her sister-in-law Cadance. She was about to knock on the front door when Cadance opened it and jumped on her with a hug.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twi! I didn’t expect you to visit again so soon. Did you manage to finish a month long mission in half a day?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. I wanted to stop by to remind Spike, well all of you really since I’m sure he’s already told you what I’m doing, not to do just that. It could cause complications. I need to be approachable in Ponyville and the whole archmage thing tends to be a wall. Even if the ponies I need to get in touch with don’t care, the town doesn’t need the attention I would draw to it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Go easy on him. We already scolded him a bit for giving away secrets that weren’t his.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Stepping inside, Twilight and Cadance saw Spike run by with Star Charmer running behind him. Suddenly he stopped as he saw Twilight and pushed Star Charmer in front of him.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It was her!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nah uh! You were practically begging to tell somepony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star Charmer descended into a petty argument only foals could keep up for more than a couple seconds. Twilight just face hoofed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Listen up! Both of you. I don’t care who’s at fault. Look,” Twilight bent down to the duo’s height, “it’s really, really important that you tell nopony where I am or what I’m doing. If I weren’t pushing to have use of memory magic the most severely punished crime after murder — for four years now — I’d simply wipe the knowledge from both of you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star Charmer both gulped at the same time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“W—We promise not to say anything.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good.” Twilight’s stern face melted into a smile as she stood back up, adding, “And if you keep that promise, I may have something special for you when I get back.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both looked expectantly at Twilight and then each other.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now go back to whatever you were doing. Fleeing, maybe?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike looked away a bit embarrassed. Star Charmer whispered something in his ear and the pair left.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight turned to Cadance and said, “I expect no less from you and Shining.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know Twi. I can keep a secret. We both can.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, like getting married.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance winced at being reminded of that particularly ill planned surprise. “We’ve apologized for that for years now Twi. Can’t you let it go?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not as long as it remains effective to guilt trip you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance pouted and said, “You’re not cute anymore.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can accept that. Anyways, if you <span style=" font-style:italic;">do</span> tell anypony, then I think I’ll be calling you Mi Amore Cadenza for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Eww! Twi, I hate my title!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then don’t tell anypony and you won’t have to hear it from me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re really not cute!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Blame the nobility. They took all my cuteness and shaped it anew in their own image. Now it’s just a ball of irritation.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance softened a bit of her act. “Well, I can understand that. Putting that aside, do you want to stay for supper? Shining should be back soon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’d love to, but I have a train to catch. Another time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s horn started to glow for a teleport but then stopped.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“By the way, thanks again for putting up with Spike for a month.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, it’s no problem. Star Charmer just loves Spike and it’s always fun with him around. The only thing I’m worried about is catching them making out.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight laughed. “I know right. He was reluctant to come until I reminded him Star Charmer was here. After that, he was positively giddy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance and Twilight shared the laugh of a troubled parent.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After calming down, Twilight’s smile turned to a frown. “Cadance. The mission this time…could become really dangerous near the end. If…I don’t return—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance hugged Twilight again, but far more gently. Letting go, she nuzzled Twilight’s neck and said, “Oh, Twi. If anything ever happens to you, we will take in Spike. I can’t tell you not to put yourself in danger, but all the same, don’t die.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you,” Twilight said, horn beginning to glow. “If I finish the first half of my task early, I’ll make time to come visit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And she was gone.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There were many things Twilight disliked, but it would seem she had another item to add to the list. Trains. They were so dreadfully slow and rabidly uninteresting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Before Twilight got on the train, she had gotten into character. The character of one Index Code, a small-time government employee usually functioning as a librarian of both actual libraries and bureaucratic paperwork. Index was one of many fake identities Twilight and Celestia put together years ago for these kinds of occasions.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ponyville had been given complete creative freedom in hosting the Summer Sun Celebration. Index was being sent only to supervise and make sure the festival would be ready in time. Of course, this meant she would have a lot of free time to socialize, not being tasked with anything of great importance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Outside the train station in a dark alley, Twilight cast Polymorph to disguise herself. It was widely agreed that Index Code was fairly young unicorn, had a light-yellow coat, a white mane, and a book cutie mark. Of course, this was a wide agreement between distant ponies that had never actually met each other and had met Index only once or twice.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Next, Twilight pulled out of her portable pocket a set of saddlebags and a slightly mismatched suitcase. Finally, Twilight tied her mane into a braid and put on a pair of glasses that corrected her frankly terrible vision in this form.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her disguise fully prepared, Index stepped out of the alley, confidently walking as if she had some legitimate business back there that was now finished. Index purchased her ticket, checked in her luggage, and boarded the train. Being on a budget, but not a personal one, her seat was comfortable but not private.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When the train finally left the station, nopony had taken a seat near Index. It seemed that this particular time of day was not popular for traveling. An hour passed and Index was well and thoroughly bored, wishing she had brought a book she had a plausible reason to read.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Note to Self: Create a mode of transportation for the teleport-impaired that I don’t get an urge to destroy.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index rhythmically banged her head on the window in time with clacking of the train’s wheels on the tracks.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A purple earth pony approached Index, looking concerned. “Excuse me, may I join you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s head turned rapidly away from the window and she half-shouted, “Yes! Please! I’m soooo bored!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The earth pony laughed softly. “Is this your first time on a train?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">My first time as Index.</span> “It is not my usual mode of transportation, no. I forgot to bring something, anything, to do. Please make conversation at me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My name’s Cheerilee,” the purple pony introduced herself, barely stifling another laugh.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Index Code. Just Index is fine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So Index, where are you headed?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index almost reflexively teleported Cheerilee out of the train in response to a personal question but checked herself when she remembered that this was a mundane conversation, not politics. Then she reminded herself that Index can’t teleport.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Remember Index, if you cough up personal information first, the other pony will feel obligated to respond. Sharing information’s the first step in making friends.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ponyville. I’m supervising preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. Although, in practice, it more or less means I get to socialize for a month. I’m just there to make sure the festival doesn’t self-destruct.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds wonderful. I teach at Ponyville elementary. A lot of ponies think that being a teacher means I get summers off to goof around but it’s actually pretty busy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What were you doing in Canterlot? Sightseeing?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Visiting family, actually. My parents moved to Canterlot years ago and are getting on in years so they never come for visits.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um…” Index began, dropping her head down.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m afraid I didn’t catch that, Index.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index pulled her head back up and pushed up her glasses. “I’m kind of new to socializing. Would this be a good point to gush over my own colt?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re a mother? You look a tad bit young.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why, oh why, didn’t we make Index look older? This is so embarrassing.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The circumstances…were beyond my control,” Index said, blushing a bit at the implications of what she said. “Not that— I mean— This isn’t coming out right. I haven’t— That is, I— He’s adopted.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The whirlwind of Index’s words over, Cheerilee smiled, replying, “That’s so kind. I’m sure whatever caused that was terrible, but I’m glad you’re happy together now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well. There’s no terrible backstory. He was just sort of found and we bonded.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">All technically true. </span>“I have no idea who his biological parents are.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s even more sweet. I wish there were more ponies like you in the world. It would mean the world for— Oh, please forget I mentioned anything.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I take it you have an orphaned student.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I didn’t know that happened in small towns like Ponyville.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s a sad fact of life that some fillies are given the short straw from the beginning.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And that some teachers continue to reveal information.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“’Fillies.’”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh. I just can’t learn to keep my mouth shut. Everypony knows about one of them but the foals don’t know about the other. Please don’t mention it to any of them.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cheerilee, I work directly for the government. Tight lips are part of the package. Also, you contributed more information with that too.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee face-hoofed. “Maybe we should change the topic before I tell you their darkest secrets too. So, do you want to ‘gush’ about your colt?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do I?” Index grinned.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Although it was pretty one-sided, Index managed to hold a conversation with Cheerilee at the way to Ponyville.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The train arrived into Ponyville station and Index and Cheerilee said their goodbyes after collecting their luggage.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, I was under duress, but I managed to hold a proper conversation with a stranger. I award myself one friendship point. That Cheerilee might be able to use the element of honesty, considering how terrifically bad at keeping secrets she is. I’ll have to throw her Honesty’s sphere later to check.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Now, where’s whats-her-name. Pinkie Pie, I think— Oh.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">An earth pony that seemed to ooze pink was waiting, waving around a greeting sign labeled ‘Welcome to Ponyville, Index!’, and was surrounded by balloons and other decorations including what looked like a cannon. For what purpose the canon was there, Index had no clue.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index and Pinkie locked eyes and Pinkie was at Index’s side, as suddenly as teleportation for all intents and purposes. Index reflexively magically flung the hyper pony away from her but somehow she returned in a blink on the other side of Index and initiated a hug. This time, Index managed to control her reflexes, but could do no more than fall down stunned while Pinkie continued her hug.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Welcome to Ponyville, Index! We’re so glad to have you here!” The mare spewed off almost faster than Index could hear. Then the cannons, apparently party cannons that shot confetti, went off. “My name is Pinkie Pie. I live at the Sugarcube Corner. Mayor Mare arranged for you to stay with us while you’re here. We’re going to have so much fun together. Your welcome party’s tonight too. If you want to make it in time we’ll have to get going. The mayor wants to welcome you and who knows how long that will take. I’ve got your luggage, so let’s go.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was pulled out of the station, already free of decorations somehow, and into Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What?</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was still traumatized after a minute sitting with Mayor Mare and <span style=" font-style:italic;">not</span> with Pinkie Pie. Mayor Mare was rubbing her back and holding her shoulder.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m terribly sorry, Index. I forgot the effect Pinkie has on newcomers. Especially visiting officials.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t understand. What <span style=" font-style:italic;">is</span> she?” Index asked, head in her hooves.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She’s just an earth pony like me…” Mayor Mare reassured Twilight, but the unease in her voice was far from convincing. “She’s in charge of hospitality for Ponyville which is why visitors usually stay with her. I can understand if you want to stay somewhere else.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. I couldn’t do that. I have a month here that will be simply awful if I don’t make friends. I can’t start out snubbing local kindness.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">And besides, I </span>have<span style=" font-style:italic;"> to know what she is. Unmitigated panic means the source is important to study.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s nopony in town that would hold fleeing from Pinkie against you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you, but I can deal with her…next time. I just wasn’t expecting…” Index faltered for words.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pinkie,” Mayor Mare finished.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. But if you could tell her to tone it down, that would be great.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t worry about that. After your party tonight she’ll cool off. A bit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index gulped, then nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, on to business. We started planning the festival the moment we received word we would be hosting it this year.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ve already lined up a team of caterers. Big Macintosh of Sweet Apple Acres is organizing them with the help of his younger sister, Applejack. As the date approaches, Pinkie Pie will be in charge of decorations.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ve contracted several entertainers to come, and the usual carnival events will arrive within a couple weeks. We expect the first contractee to arrive in the next couple days and the rest should come along slowly after that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Finally, Vinyl Scratch has volunteered to manage the music and sound systems. That’s the big overview of what we have so far. The fine details are in this dossier.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mayor Mare passed the dossier to Index who glanced through it at a not-at-all troubling reading speed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“DJ Pon-3?” Index asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That would be Vinyl Scratch. As the name suggests, she usually works as a DJ. She has agreed to keep the music toned down to an acceptable level.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index nodded and finished browsing the dossier.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, it seems you’re doing pretty well. I’m sure you already know, but just a reminder, I’m just here to make sure you don’t crash and burn. I’ll look through this in detail later and I’ll expect updates as they come, though not in real time, of course. Have fun with this and if you do well you may be given the chance to host the festival again in the near future.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you don’t mind my asking, why is Ponyville hosting the Summer Sun Celebration? It’s always been held in a large city before.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s an excellent question, that I’m not at all clear on. From what I understand, you’d have to ask that question directly to Princess Celestia or Archmage Twilight Sparkle. If you want my honest opinion though, I think they just want a few days away from the cities to relax.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both mares grinned and Index turned to leave only to freeze at the door.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-style:italic;">She</span> is waiting for me.” Mayor Mare looked on concerned as Index psyched herself up. “This is pathetic. I will master this fear. She means me no harm.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index left. Mayor Mare turned to her window to watch Index leave with Pinkie Pie. Things…seemed to be going well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“At least she hasn’t broken out the one-mare band.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That night Index had her first Pinkie Party. Her memory of it the next morning was a blur, and probably better off so. At least she met some ponies who would likely remember her tomorrow.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, it didn’t stop the nightmares.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was Index’s second day in Ponyville. She had escaped Pinkie Pie, who had cooled off considerably as Mayor Mare predicted but not as much as Index would have liked, earlier this morning. Now she was wandering around town, holding conversations with ponies that recognized her from her party the night before.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had just finished talking with an earth pony named Sweetie Drops and had left the mare’s house when she caught the lingering presence of well-concealed magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">All ponies had magic, and there were plenty of unicorns in the predominately earth pony town, so there was a magical background noise to the city. That she noticed the spell at all was as much a testament to her own abilities as it was to luck.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">However, it was a spell she was always wary of.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Polymorph…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index turned back to Sweetie Drops’s house and knocked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Back already? Did you forget something?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was just wondering if any unicorns lived nearby. I’m a bit of an academic. I noticed an interesting spell and wanted to discuss it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, that would probably be my roommate. She just left actually. She’ll be back tonight after sunset if you want to talk then. Actually, why don’t we make it a dinner date?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index nodded assent and thanked Sweetie Drops and left again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This should be interesting.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s next destination was the library to get some easy reading. However, a random encounter awaited her along the way.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I call this meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order,” Apple Bloom said. “Do we have any ideas to try today?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ve got a whole bunch,” Scootaloo replied.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, go on then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ehem. Stilts, pet-sitting, mountain climbing, reading, herding, sweets making, and story telling.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Reading, Scoots?” Sweetie Belle asked. “That’s not like you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo shrugged. “The way I see it, we need to expand our activities. We don’t seem to be having any success with our normal ones, so I started adding more unusual ones.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good idea,” said Apple Bloom, “but some another time. I’m not really in the mood.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Mountain climbing would be fun,” Sweetie Belle offered.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If only we had a mountain to climb,” Apple Bloom countered. “If nopony minds, I’d vote for herding. My sister was looking for some help with corralling earlier.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle looked to each other and nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then all three in unison shouted their oft changing motto.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cutie Mark Crusader, Corralers, Yay!”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had little time to ponder how much magic she should use to not die. She quickly determined it would be fine to levitate herself several meters up and watch the scene unfolding below her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What in Equestria is a stampede doing in town?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Looking in the direction the stampede had come from she could see three fillies, one of each pony kind, desperately trying to stop or at least redirect the stampede. At the front was an orange earth pony having much more success in adverting damage to the town.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">There’s no way I can solve this problem and not draw undue attention…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index went back to watching the fillies, not having anything else to do until the danger passed. Now that she watched closer, the earth filly was actually doing quite well, as far as Index could tell. It would make sense, she did look an awful lot like the mare at the front.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Probably sisters.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The pegasus was keeping up if nothing else. Using a bizarre combination of wings and scooter Index had never seen before, she was at least moving fast enough to be considered part of the stampede.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The unicorn was doing less well. Clearly the least athletic of the trio, she was panting for breath as she struggled to keep pace on roller skates powered by both muscle and magic. Unfortunately for her, she tried to skate over the dossier Index had dropped in her panic and tumbled over in the outskirts of the stampede.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Perhaps a little too quickly, Index yanked Sweetie Belle out of the stampede to join her in the air, the filly still flailing around trying to recover her balance. The absolute horror on Sweetie’s face gradually disappeared as she realized she was not in anyway trampled and resurfaced a bit once finding herself floating for no particular reason.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Relax,” Index reassured, “you’re safe.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index pulled Sweetie up to eye level and smiled.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“T—Thank you so much,” Sweetie said, catching her breath. “I was so sure that was going to be the end for me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No need to thank me. You did stumble on something I dropped in a panic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well,” Sweetie began, averting her eyes, “this stampede is sort of our fault anyways…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t worry about that right now. I know how scary it is to be near death. Whatever part you played in this, just forget about it until later.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index set Sweetie down on her back and floated ahead to watch over the stampede leaving behind the thoroughly trampled dossier.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Where are we going?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, so long as I’ve saved one life, I might as well make sure nopony else is in trouble.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie’s eyes widened. “You’re like a hero!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Like?” Index playfully pouted.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You <span style=" font-style:italic;">are</span> a hero! You’re even cooler than Rainbow Dash!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now that’s more like it,” Index said, obviously over-exaggerating her ego. “I almost fear to ask, but your comment sort of suggests this kind of thing happen a lot here. Is that true?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie nodded and when she realized Index couldn’t see her, said, “Yeah, all the time. Just a few days ago a unicorn suffered a panic attack and cast a Want It Need It spell on some old stuffed animal.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I think I need to discuss small-town recreation with Celestia.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Somehow, the orange mare and two fillies managed to get the stampede out of town and out to Sweet Apple Acres without further incident. Index was impressed by the mare’s skills, even if they were skills she would never want or need.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once the herd was outside of Ponyville, Index set down and walked after the dust trail with Sweetie skating at her side. By the time Index arrived at the corral, she understood exactly why acres was part of the name, and was not looking forward to the walk back.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Seeing their approach, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom ran up to Sweetie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sweetie, where did you go?” Apple Bloom asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was almost trampled, but Index saved me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What!” Both of the other crusaders exclaimed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s awful,” Scootaloo continued. “Thank you so much for saving Sweetie, Index.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We would be right lost without her,” Apple Bloom added.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It was no trouble. Just be more careful in the future. You only get one try at life.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The two crusaders that hadn’t brushed with death gulped while Sweetie shivered a bit. The trio gave their thanks again and ran off together.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After they had left, the big sister looking earth pony approached Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I overheard that, sugar-cube. Thank you mightily for what you did. It would have been downright terrible if she had been injured. I’ll set them straight later once they’ve settled down.” The mare extended a hoof and added, “I’m Applejack.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index took the hoof and replied, “Index Code. Just Index is fine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, you’re that Canterlot official Pinkie Pie was talking about yesterday. I hope she wasn’t too much for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m…coping.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s good. Now, would you like some homemade Apple apple pie? I’ve got a whole mess of samples made for Mayor Mare. I’m sure she wouldn’t mind if one or two went missing like zap apples on the fifth day.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds delightful. I haven’t eaten yet today.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, we’ll just need to fix that then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index followed Applejack inside the Apple house, enjoyed both lunch and an apple pie, and met the remaining two members of the Apple family, Big Macintosh and Granny Smith.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">On her way back to Ponyville and to the library, Index pulled her saddlebags and the sealed elements out of storage and draped the bags across her. She had earlier wanted to try seeing if Cheerilee could use one and this detour was the perfect excuse.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">‘She had taken Sweetie out to Sweet Apple Acres, decided to take a walk, gotten lost near the Everfree, found these things, and needed somepony with better eyesight to look inside.’</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Technically, Index only thought Honesty would approve of Cheerilee, if any would, but it would be silly not to check them all anyways. It would be very awkward and require a lot of explaining if she came back with four more later.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But first, the library.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The Golden Oak Library was small by most standards, and minuscule in comparison to the Canterlot archives, but it would have to do. It was Ponyville’s only library after all.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Index reached for the door, it slammed open and she barely managed to stop it in time from hitting her in the face.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sor— Oh, you’re fine. Whatever. Still sorry. But I was never here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The cloaked and hooded pony that had almost broken Index’s nose ran off into the back roads and semi-alleys of Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Never here indeed. I wonder if she realizes the cloak makes her more conspicuous. The rainbow colored hair certainly doesn’t make her any less forgettable.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index starred at where the pony had vanished to for a moment longer and then returned to her task of obtaining books.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had managed to find Cheerilee’s house easily enough. She had assumed more or less correctly when she thought that everypony in Ponyville would know every other pony. The foals were less in the know, but the adults seemed to have all the information one could reasonably ask for.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index knocked on the door and was greeted by an excited Cheerilee.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I hope I’m not interrupting anything,” Index said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee shook her head. “Not at all, Index. Come on in.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The two mares went inside and sat at Cheerilee’s kitchen table while they waited for water to boil for tea.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, what brings you by?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, as I mentioned on the train, my job here is mostly just me socializing. I’ve got nothing to do until dinner and wondered if we could talk some more. That and I’m sort of avoiding…Pinkie…until I can gather my courage to face her again. I think I’m getting better at that. I feel kind of bad being scared of her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I remember when Pinkie first moved to town. She came from a family of miners operating a family quarry. She was pretty miserable there. When she came here though, she pretty much went out of hoof and it was a while before Ponyville slept. Still, she mellowed with time. Even she couldn’t keep up that level of energy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both mares shared a laugh slightly tinged by bad memories. Then the kettle cried out that the tea was ready, causing Index to jump and ‘accidentally’ knock over her saddlebags. The sealed elements of harmony rolled out onto the floor. Index also took the opportunity to put up a few spells to muffle sound and bright lights while Cheerilee’s attention was drawn away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee turned back from finishing the tea and noticed Index collecting the elements. “What are those?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I have no idea,” Index answered. She then followed up with the story she had developed earlier. “I would appreciate it if you’d take a look inside them. My eyesight’s not as good as I would like.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Certainly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index levitated over each element in turn as heard them described exactly as she had seen them. She last gave over Honesty and was disappointed that nothing happened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, well. I see the elements aren’t going to give me a break on this.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you know what they are?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index shook her head as she repacked the elements. “I’ve tried opening them too, with some force, but couldn’t. I was going to visit the Canterlot Archives when I finish my work here. I might be able to figure something out there.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Let me know if you ever find out. My curiosity will consume me if I don’t know.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know the feeling.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, discussing strange artifacts is not the reason you came here. You got cut off by the train before, but I’d love to hear more about this illicit relationship between your colt and niece.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index left Cheerilee’s house just before sunset. They had spent most of the time chatting and near the end Index had done some minor spellwork for Cheerilee. Nothing fancy, just some minor conveniences.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">It’s too bad Cheerilee’s not a bearer. I wish I had some way to scold Honesty, or something.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was some time before Index noticed just exactly what she had thought.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Wait…I’m…disappointed? Is Cheerilee a friend?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index paused to consider the question.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That doesn’t sound quite right. I like her well enough, at least as Index I do, but something just seems off. If she was in trouble, would I come racing to help her? No, that’s a loaded moral question. I’d rush off to save anypony.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Would I choose to spend time with her over, say, research? Hmm… If I were not rooming with Pinkie, what would I have done instead today? Well, pretty much the same thing. But supposing I was not required to be socializing, what would I have done? Would I have wanted to continue talking with Cheerilee just to pass the time?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index resumed walking, nearly running into a couple ponies along her way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No, I would have been in my room. I do feel kind of bad about that, but it’s the truth. Still, it’s a step in the right direction. I’ll take another friendship point.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index reached Sweetie Drops’s house and dropped her train of thought. She could feel the presence of the Polymorph spell much clearer this time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Approaching the door, Index knocked.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra Heartstrings could tell that a Polymorph spell, an incredibly well concealed one, was getting closer and closer to her home. Bon Bon had mentioned a dinner guest interested in a spell Lyra had cast, and now Lyra was hoping that guest was not polymorphed more than she had wanted anything in the past six years.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She felt the Polymorph stop in front of the house and then a knock came from the door.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Horseapples!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon lead the guest into the dinning room and introduced each other.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s very nice to meet you, Lyra,” Index said, standing just far enough away to not seem disrespectful.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And you as well,” Lyra said, similarly not closing the distance. “Please take a seat and let’s dig in.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Neither unicorn’s horn glowed. A fiercely protected secret, but a quite obvious one to unicorns that studied fields outside magic, was to change the wavelength of the emitted light to one outside the visible spectrum. Spellcasting so disguised was utterly undetectable by earth and pegasus ponies. Very helpful when dinning with an naive earth pony.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of course, Lyra and Index weren’t fooling each other so they weren’t even bothering trying to hide their spells from each other. Both were constantly checking their food in case some non-magical means was used to slip in some poison, acid or other malign substance. Polymorphs were, despite legitimate medical applications, bad news over 99% of the time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, Bon Bon said you wanted to talk to me about something.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, I saw your spell in the street earlier. It was well done and subtle enough I almost didn’t notice it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you. I noticed some of your craft as well. It was almost as well done.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The compliment is appreciated. It’s out of my area of expertise so I was worried it wouldn’t work out.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re underselling yourself. I’m probably the only pony in town that would notice. It is my area of specialization.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s very interesting. I don’t usually run into peaceful applications of the spell. I’d love to see some old photos or something of the site to see how it’s changed.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You could ask around town for some. Mayor Mare should have a lot documented as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh? Maybe I should have stopped there first. But I’d hate to bother her with private investigations.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie Drops looked on in confusion, having no idea what the mares were talking about. “Girls, what spell are you talking about.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index turned to Sweetie and answered, “The one Lyra put on the roads around here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I put a weak disintegrate spell on the road to keep it clean. No, I can’t cast the full version and it wouldn’t work well on dishes or clothes. I never bothered to tell you because it’s really only interesting to academics.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie still felt like she was missing something. Something about how they were talking probably. But they were both so affable. “Alright. Thanks for clarifying.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, that’s one of the highlights of the past few <span style=" font-style:italic;">years</span>,” Lyra stressed. “What brings you to Ponyville?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Summer Sun Celebration. I’m sure you’ve heard Ponyville is hosting it this year.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I have.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m overseeing it. No real creative control, just checking that things stay on schedule.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sounds like you’ll have a lot of free time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Indeed. I’ve been spending it socializing. There’s a lot of interesting ponies here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“One more now it seems.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I like to think so. Do you have any interest in fairy tales?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“On occasion. I’m rather fond of <span style=" font-style:italic;">The Little Seapony</span>.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index choked on her food.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Index!” Bon Bon shouted. Then seeing Index recover, asked, “Are you all right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. I just haven’t remembered that story in a while. It was one of my favorites as a filly, although I made my parents read me the story about the mare in the moon more.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t recognize that one.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s a related tale to the culture surrounding Nightmare Night. Sort of an origin story for Nightmare Moon. It’s a rather sad story. Actually, I’ve just had a thought. I would appreciate some company walking off this dinner, which was great by the way. Thank you Bon Bon. I could tell you the story and we could discuss more in depth on our respective magics.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra nodded. <span style=" font-style:italic;">I really wish she would have just run off at the mention of seaponies. Still, talking is better than being attacked in my sleep. She’s being up front enough, so she probably doesn’t want a murder around. But still, she clearly at least knows of memory spells…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I’m just trying to find a way to rationalize away my situation. I haven’t fought in six years…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra really, <span style=" font-style:italic;">really</span>, wanted to bang her head on the table. But that would be a give away to Bon Bon and an opening to the potential threat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This is a bad night…</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index led Lyra out of the house and down the street towards the edge of town. The two marched in silence, standing close together only to not draw questions from ponies that were still wandering around this late.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once they were a bit out of town and hidden by the trees of Sweet Apple Acres, they moved apart. They continued to walk in silence a bit longer.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index asked, “Do you teleport?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then write down a random destination. I’ll do the same. We’ll meet in the middle for some privacy. Range limit fifty kilometers.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s a bit far…I’ll just put down Ponyville.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The pair exchanged coordinates. Index had chosen almost a full fifty kilometers due east and openly grinned when Lyra passed her the Ponyville coordinates.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do over!” Lyra panicked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s not how this works, you predictable pony. Besides, I choose the location for you, not for me. See you there.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index disappeared in a silent teleport.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, horseapples. She can probably hunt me down if I flee…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">She wouldn’t have grinned if she meant to kill me. Right? Yeah. That’s a good rationalization…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Idling for a moment, Lyra gathered up the power she needed for a long range teleport and left in a much less graceful pop.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra reappeared just outside Saddle Lake.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Whew. I haven’t done anything magically exhausting in a while. I hope Index doesn’t notice that.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Looking around Lyra finally noticed she had arrived next to Saddle Lake. Understanding came immediately concerning what Index had meant when she said she choose this place for Lyra.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index stood a little ways off, having either laid no traps or having activated none. Likely the former since this location was probably chosen on a whim.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now then,” Index began, “we can stay here or we can move towards the lake.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And why would we do that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because I am in a bit of a time crunch, so I’ll have to be blunter than I would like in dealing with you. I’m sure you would feel better if you have somewhere you think you can escape to.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’d rather stay put, actually. Perhaps later.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Very well. I’ll go first.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index began the counter-spell for Polymorph and targeted herself, although Lyra was under no delusion that Index couldn’t redirect it at the last moment to anypony. Yet Index finished the spell on herself, and, as far as Lyra could tell, did not cast any other spells, illusions or otherwise.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s form melted away leaving a purple unicorn beneath with a purple and pink mane and tail.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Where have I seen this pony before. It’s on the tip of my…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra’s eyes flew open in recognition.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see you recognize me. That makes things easier. Now, ‘citizen’, if you want to remain in Equestria, you <span style=" font-style:italic;">will</span> tell me what the greatest horror of the ocean depths is doing in Ponyville, approximately the furthest town from an ocean in Equestria.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra fumbled at putting words together words under Twilight’s cold glare. Eventually she managed a weak, “s-second g-g-greatest horror.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What?” Twilight asked, incredulous.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“W—we’re only the second greatest horror… You’re f—forgetting the r—reason seaponies are all psy—psychopaths.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s mouth hung open, clearly having been given an answer far from any she had expected. Seeming to think carefully about how to proceed, Twilight gave Lyra a moment to recover.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose you’re right,” Twilight finally said. “But for you to not only acknowledge that, but actually be scared… Are you really a seapony?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra nodded and motioned towards the lake, teleporting above the water and splashing shortly after. Twilight followed after but stayed on shore.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra dusted off her memories of the Polymorph counter-spell, long gone unused, and began casting. A few seconds later, Lyra was once again a seapony. Swimming around with muscles she hadn’t used in years, Lyra approached the shoreline.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight scowled, but then seemed to think better of it. “Care to explain why you’re sane?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Six-years without battling eldritch horrors will do that to a pony,” Lyra said, surprising herself with how flippantly she had said it. “I’ll admit the polymorph spell seems to have some positive effects as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I don’t really need or want you grovelling, so why don’t you stay that way for now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I did not grov— Okay, I did a bit of grovelling. Polymorphing really does seem to temper my mood.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So the polymorph and lack of horrors from the depths explains why you haven’t caused any problems, but why are you here at all?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That is deeply personal and I don’t feel like sharing with <span style=" font-style:italic;">you</span>. Argh! Why am I so confrontational!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine. Whatever. I don’t really care so long as you’re not going to rampage in Ponyville or interfere with my work.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Which is?” Lyra asked, splashing around in well-practiced, but long unused, defensive maneuvers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight gave a <span style=" font-style:italic;">long</span> sigh and rubbed her forehead with her hoof. “Making friends to stop an evil goddess from probably destroying the world because the ancient magical artifacts that can be used to defeat her are powered by friendship.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra stopped and merely tread water. “Want to run that by me again?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not really. Just. Look” — Twilight pulled Honesty out of storage — “I have five of these in addition the one meant for me. Take a look inside.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight threw Honesty to Lyra who caught it with her magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s a necklace inside.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right. The actual artifact is the necklace. The outer shell is a sort of cocoon the element protects itself with until an appropriate wielder comes along. They each have some interesting abilities — mine also includes the ability to recall all of them — but together they have a sort of restorative effect.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Basically, we need each element to choose a bearer and every bearer has to be friends or else the healing ability won’t work. It’s all very unnecessary, but that’s how it always is with ancient magical artifacts. For some reason. At least ancient civilizations — or whoever — didn’t go around building things that could destroy the world.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Naturally, this is a secret. You know why you are being told, as I know why you revealed your identity. If you buck anything up, I will make it my mission in life to obliterate you before Nightmare Moon can do so to me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If Lyra had been a unicorn, she would have been very intimidated. Instead she was having to check her impulse to lash out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine. Pinkie Promises all around then?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That was an impressive reaction. I should hang around Pinkie Pie more.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What, exactly, is a Pinkie Promise?” Twilight asked after no short pause.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra explained the general motions of what exactly a Pinkie Promise was. She also explained the consequences of breaking one.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you seriously telling me that Pinkie somehow knows whenever a Pinkie Promise is broken?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Even as a seapony, I fear the fate that befalls ponies that break Pinkie Promises. The Pinkie Promise is essentially unbreakable, although the one being promised can release the promise maker, and is likely the only way we can trust each other. You can feel free to gather evidence later. I won’t be offended.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course, the evidence could all be tainted by memory spells and other fabrications.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re free to test it yourself.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. I think I’ll pass on that honor.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight and Lyra both went through the motions, promising not to reveal each other or purposefully disrupt each other’s lives.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Can you give me back Honesty now? I think we’re done here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra had been a waterball player as a filly. The game was played exclusively with tails and the game often featured play above the ocean surface to enable faster passes. Lyra dove in a circle and whipped her tail up above the surface to kick the element back to Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Instead of a solid kick, she whiffed and was temporarily blinded. Immediately reacting to what she thought was an attack, Lyra readied herself for battle underwater and was perplexed when not only were no spells being flung her way, but she felt something hanging onto her tail.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cautiously surfacing, Lyra looked for Twilight and found she had not moved but was engaged in shouting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you bucking serious, Honesty! I personified you! I gave you to Cheerilee, by far the most honest pony in Ponyville I’ve met so far! And you give me Lyra Heartstrings! How does that make <span style=" font-style:italic;">any</span> sense! Ugh!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra looked down at her tail and saw the necklace that was probably what Twilight was referring to as Honesty. The previously gray gem had turned into a brilliant orange. The gem had changed shape, but it had not used the lyre cutie-mark Lyra had adopted. Instead it had taken the shape of a bubble, one of many that made up her original cutie-mark.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Somehow, Lyra felt it was only natural that Honesty had chosen her.</p>

<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I never thought the Everfree could be so utterly boring,” Daisy said to nopony in particular: Princess Celestia was busy concentrating on her sixteenth spell for the night.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At first, the old castle had been scary and Daisy had jumped at every little sound. An owl in the distance — a face-plant on the ground. A stone crumbling from some anonymous corner of the castle — a panicked glance in every direction twice.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After a few hours with absolutely nothing happening, Daisy simply sat watching Princess Celestia work her magic, occasionally fiddling with the tiara on her brow.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Eventually Princess Celestia finished her spell and replied to Daisy as if there weren’t five minutes of silence between then and now. “Tomorrow you should bring a book.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I didn’t mean that!” — Daisy rushed to her hooves — “I mean, it’s an honor to watch you work. It was merely a comment on the forest.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia sighed. It had taken her years to get filly Twilight to address her normally. There was no reason to expect Daisy to treat her as anything less than a goddess after less than a week.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No offense was taken. I know exactly how boring watching somepony cast spell after spell can be.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight? She mentioned something about security spells.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, not her. Other students and friends long past.” Celestia waved away the look of sympathy in Daisy’s eyes. “Even as a filly, Twilight never needed somepony constantly looking over her. Just nudges in the right direction.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia began casting her next spell, smiling a bit.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy had meant it when she said it was an honor watching Princess Celestia cast magic. If she described Twilight’s spellwork as efficacious, then Princess Celestia’s would be overpowering. Seeing spells woven with the princess’s raw power, and fine details that showed Twilight’s hoof, awoke old feelings of her school days.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But Daisy had never been one to learn just by watching. That was a talent she reserved for what she called academic monsters.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was probably one of them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">So Daisy could choose to have an intellectual itch she couldn’t scratch. Or she could be bored. The latter was more appealing.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had finished her tantrum and was lying on a summoned couch. A re-polymorphed Lyra was sitting nearby on a similar couch Twilight had been gracious enough to conjure. And since Twilight already knew her secret, Lyra reshaped the couch to fit her preferences.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even as a unicorn, she still enjoyed sitting on her back and rump instead of her barrel. It was a tell on her seapony origins, but Lyra figured the only ones that would know would notice the polymorph spell as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight glanced towards the fake unicorn. <span style=" font-style:italic;">Honestly, Honesty, what’s honest about her?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sitting up, Twilight forced herself to face Lyra. “So. Can you explain how you embody honesty?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Honesty to self perhaps? I didn’t want to live under the sea, so I left. Pretending I’m a unicorn is incidental to that, not out of some deep seeded desire to fool everypony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight grit her teeth. <span style=" font-style:italic;">I guess that makes sense. She effectively </span>is<span style=" font-style:italic;"> a unicorn anyways since she has identical magic.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">She’s still lying by omission by not telling anypony about her past. But why should she? It’s not like ponies rattle off their life stories to each other when introduced.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I guess I assume she has one hay-of-a ‘deeply personal’ backstory and leave it at that.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Lyra” — Twilight emphasized her name — “I’m going to be your friend, and I’m going to like it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Were you a mob lackey at some point?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. But there’s some overlap in our job descriptions. Now listen up. I’m going to explain the situation in more detail.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight elaborated on the extremely skimpy explanation she had given earlier. She especially stressed how dangerous Nightmare Moon was to the <span style=" font-style:italic;">entire</span> world.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So your plan is to get yourself, a pony admittedly having only two friends — one recently — outside of family, five new friends with ridiculously difficult requirements, and I’m one of them…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Unfortunately.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you even hear yourself?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll try to put my reasoning exactly as I though it. Celestia has had a thousand years to think of solutions and using the elements of harmony is the only real one she has.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excuse me,” Lyra interrupted, “but I must ask if Princess Celestia is smart.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She and I are in the same standard deviation. Moving on. She has nopony to use the elements. And they only became usable recently, not that she could gather six ponies a hundred years early.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, ponies capable of bearing Magic are more or less as…secluded as myself. So if I can come up with a solution it has to involve myself. Myself being the only pony whose actions I can realistically expect to influence. I already have two friendship points even.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra opened her mouth to ask but Twilight interjected, “They’re points I give myself when I do something friend making-ish. I may drop the system in the future. It doesn’t seem to be helping.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra raised a hoof, ready to comment, but no words came forth.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So here I am trying to make some very specific kinds of friends. You have no choice but to believe me because otherwise Honesty there would have told you I was lying, which I’m not so far as I can reasonably be expected to know if I were.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You did mention something about abilities. Lie detection does seem thematically appropriate. Why don’t you give me some examples.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am an alicorn.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh. Tingly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am not an alicorn.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nothing. That’s good. I’d hate to live in an inconsistent universe.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I will be an alicorn.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…I can’t tell what exactly, but something was wrong there.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s the down side of Honesty. According to Celestia, it can only tell you whether or not the speaker believes what is said to be true.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s disappointing. An oracle machine would have been the single greatest gift I could have ever been given. So then, if a pony simultaneously holds conflicting beliefs, I get a mixed response from the element.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight nodded. “You know, I think we might be able to make this friendship thing work.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Me too. The ele…Honesty is very useful. Like a shortcut through a million trust exercises.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Let’s just hope we like each other.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“They do say a common enemy brings ponies together. We can’t do much better than an insane goddess. Or should I say, a lunatic goddess.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Bubbles</span> — Twilight noticed Lyra’s true cutie mark — <span style=" font-style:italic;">One of the seapony magic focused cutie marks.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, we can definitely make this work. Tell me, do you do much research? No. Well, that’s probably for the best. I guess we’ll have to find something else…”</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon threw Twilight to the ground from her dais. Lyra stood at her side.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Lyra! How could you? Nightmare Moon is insane!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon cackled.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Indeed. But I appreciate a little lunacy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight grit her teeth at the horrible pun delivered in worse taste.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s too bad Honesty doesn’t run both ways. You could have seen this coming a mile away.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have done well my faithful servant. Now let us welcome our true master, so that the pathetic bearer of the element of magic can join Celestia.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What? What have you done with Celestia?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon gestured to her right. Celestia was lying in a fetal position, mumbling to herself over and over again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A pony slowly faded into view on the throne.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“All hail the true queen.” Nightmare Moon and Lyra recited.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight gasped.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I have a special defeat party planned. Just— For— You—”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index screamed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, Celestia, help me. I can’t suffer these dreams any longer.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index looked up. She screamed again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie was standing right next to her looking concerned. It was far from helpful at the moment.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s wrong, Index?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nothing. Just— Just a bad dream.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s two nights of bad dreams in a row. That’s like” — Pinkie pretended to count — “more nightmares than I’ve ever had. Like ever, ever!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I— I don’t think you’re the pony I need to talk to about this.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie face twisted inward.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sorry Pinkie. I know you’re trying to help, but please understand some problems need time to heal more than words.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pursing her lips, Pinkie stood rooted to the ground. Index exchanged a long stare with her. Then finally giving up Pinkie returned to her usual perkiness.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okey-Dokey. Breakfast’s downstairs. The Cakes make delicious waffles despite the name.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right. I’ll be down soon.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once Index had finished breakfast, she set out to visit Mayor Mare to obtain a new dossier. After that she was going to collect Lyra so the two could try bonding.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">It’s so strange waking up this early. I haven’t started the day with dawn three days in a row since I was a filly. Everything feels backwards.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight wandered around on her way to town hall. Despite her unprecedented level of socialization, she hadn’t explored Ponyville much yet.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What? Ponyville has a bowling alley? And a spa? I could have sworn the population was barely pushing three thousand… Is that a costume shop? A store specializing in sofas and </span>quills<span style=" font-style:italic;">? This is an agricultural town. How… I just…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">You know what? Whatever. The archmage could use a relaxing spa visit for once.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That was just what I needed,” Index said, stretching and walking into the sauna.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hello there. Are you new in Ponyville?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. I only arrived a few days ago.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Rarity. I run the Carousel Boutique. If you ever need a dress, I do some of the best designs in Equestria.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll keep that in mind for the next gala.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">Whoops.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Grand Galloping Gala?” Rarity asked, eyes actually sparkling. “Oh, I have always wanted to go. Every year mares come to me from far and wide for dresses but I have never had a chance to attend. How ever do you manage to get a ticket?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I have connections in high places.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">To myself and an alicorn that hates attending the gala. </span>“If it means that much to you, remind me later and I can get you a ticket.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity put a hoof to her forehead and fainted away onto the sauna bench. Or at least that’s what it looked like. Index resisted rolling her eyes at the drama.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Recovering, Rarity said, “Oh, this is a dream come true! How can I ever thank you? I do not even know your name!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Index Code. Index is fine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, now I do look the ungrateful fool.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What? I don’t—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was looking everywhere for you last night but you were nowhere to be found. I wanted to thank you for saving my little sister’s life.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sweetie Bell is your sister?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She is. Darling, just ask for anything and I will put forth everything I have at my disposal to fulfill your wish.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um, thanks for the offer, but— Actually, thank you. I’ll remember your offer later if I need it.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s a friendship point for accepting thanks instead of treating her like a random citizen. Right?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So tell me, what is it like being at the gala?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Err… Honestly, I only go because my friend keeps forcing me to keep her company. Neither of us actually enjoy the gala but she has to be there. You probably wouldn’t like my opinion.” Twilight added after a moment, “Sorry.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t worry. I realize not everypony enjoys high society parties.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, if you don’t mind me unloading a bit of stress on you, I’d be glad to tell you about the gala.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Index, this is a spa. Unloading stress is exactly what a pony comes here for.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight giggled. “Alright. So this is a story from two galas ago. A unicorn pining after Prince Blueblood managed, not only to get into the gala, but to spend the night with the prince.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I heard a bit about that. From what I understand it did not end well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It was certainly no happy ending. So anyways, she and the prince spent the entire night together…”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks for putting together a second dossier for me, Mayor.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Everything’s filed in triplicate and I have a secretary to copy off another one. It was no trouble at all. It would have been far more paperwork if we had to deal with a foal death. Not that that would have been the bad part.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index couldn’t help laughing before asking, “Can you give me summary of the changes?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Other than the arrival of some of the entertainers, nothing too interesting has happened. I did get some sample pies. I should have saved one for you, but I just couldn’t resist.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Heh. Don’t worry about it. I’m sure I at some point I’ll get free pie in Ponyville.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mayor Mare had mentioned that entertainers had started showing up. Glancing over the list, Index notices one name in particular.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Beatrix? Where have I heard that name before?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Beatrix Lulamoon’s a traveling showpony. She performs under the name Trixie, The Great and Powerful—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index face-hoofed. “Of course! No one can ever forget ‘The Great and Powerful Trixie.’ She blew up the auditorium twice and the music room before they expelled her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Perhaps we should terminate her contract…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh no! This should be good fun. Believe it or not, she’s quite talented. I was sad to see her go. At a distance, there’s no better entertainment. If she’s a showpony now, I suspect she’s gone past chaos and learned control. This will be the best!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right… Well, she has the stage this afternoon to practice if you want to go watch.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll have a front row seat.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please don’t let her put the town in any danger.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. Whatever. I’m off to a play date now,” Index said, seemingly floating out of the room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A play date?” Mayor Mare said to herself. She turned to the eastern window, wishing it were sunset, and put her forehooves together thoughtfully.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I could use a play date.”</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">For reasons documented in Appendix B, Lyra Heartstrings and I are working together to observe the earth pony known as Pinkie Pie.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">A strange creature. From casual observations so far, Pinkie Pie seems to be able to survive purely on foods typically classified as desserts. Pinkie appears to suffer no negative effects from ingesting other foods, but no confirmations could be made. Weak evidence is offered by the rest of Ponyville, Pinkie’s town of residence, by testifying that Pinkie has never been sick.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Witness testimony documented in Appendix D provides evidence for the consequences of what is known as a ‘Pinkie Promise’. A Pinkie Promise is a simple ritual whereby a pony recites the line ‘Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye’ with an accompanying gesture of sticking a cupcake in one’s eye (there is no consensus on which eye or if it matters).</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">A Pinkie Promise is essentially unbreakable. As provided testimony suggests, Pinkie Pie is somehow able to know exactly who, when, and where a Pinkie Promise is broken. However, she does not seem to receive information concerning the why nor what the promise was. A terrible fate befalls those foolish enough to break their promise and not get the receiving pony to release them. Weak evidence suggests that releasing a promise has no consequences. (Lyra and I released are promises after she obtained Honesty and have suffered no ill effects).</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">The subject also exhibits many other strange behaviors and abilities. Pinkie is capable of near-teleport speeds of movement and has a frightening ability to both create and cleanup parties in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Evidence also suggests the social portion of Pinkie’s brain is highly advanced. She knows thousands of ponies on an individual level and purports to be friends with them all, showing no concern for the postulated Dunbar’s number, nor any higher number. As a side note, Pinkie keeps a toothless alligator named Gummy. No interesting phenomena have been observed with regards to the pet.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Perhaps most troubling of all, is the observations performed by Lyra and I in the past few hours. Lyra says Pinkie refers to this latest ability as her ‘Pinkie Sense’.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">The Pinkie Sense allows Pinkie to predict events that have not yet happened.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Yes.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Excuse the unprofessionalism, it is important to stress that these results are replicable.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Among the many events the Pinkie Sense reveals, is the foreknowledge of doors opening quickly, shocking events, and danger from falling objects. See Appendix C for a full list of observed Pinkie Senses and the corresponding actions Pinkie’s body performs to reveal them to her.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Her personality is fortunately not suited to evil nor mischief beyond small scale pranks. Every effort should be made to ensure she stays this way. I fear for our future should Pinkie decide to ‘turn evil’. Note that the Pinkie Sense would almost certainly prevent her capture or her termination so do not attempt.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Hopefully, further observations will help reduce the fear I have developed of this pony. Although I am unusually aware of how terrifying she is, the rest of Ponyville seems to understand my reaction and had similar ones at first. Perhaps, another ability of Pinkie is to pacify fear of her. On the other hoof, she does bare no ill-will and is very caring. Perhaps I am too distracted by her mysterious nature.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">My current hypothesis is Pinkie Pie is a demigoddess of Chaos (Friendship?) similar in nature to the creature known over a thousand years ago as Discord (Celestia assures me that if Discord were to return, he would repossess the stone body the elements of harmony left behind in Canterlot Gardens (It does occur to me to wonder how she knows that)).</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Further observations will appear in a later field report.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, I admit it. That was fun.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I told you it would be. Science is the best.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not that part. Although Pinkie <span style=" font-style:italic;">is</span> pretty interesting. I had never actually seen the Pinkie Sense in action before. I meant the whole being a bird thing.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You really never used Polymorph for anything before but being a unicorn?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I really hadn’t. It just never occurred to me. The spell was a means to an end for me and I never really had a reason to recycle it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A silence stretched as Index tried to find words to put to this statement so counter to her core character. It was really troublesome talking to the bearer of Honesty. Eventually she decided it was easiest to just drop the topic with all the grace of a hydra trying to kiss…well anything really.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was going to watch the practice runs of the entertainers that have already arrived. Do you want to come with?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I would ask what kind of shows there are, but that doesn’t matter much.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We are rather stuck with each other.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nodding, Lyra said, “Lead on, near friendless leader.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index just rolled her eyes and left with Lyra trailing right behind.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index and Lyra arrived at the first of many stages to be built for the Summer Sun Celebration. It was a simple stage made almost entirely of wood. As far as Index could tell, the only non-wood portion was the red curtain that was idling above. Index figured that when Pinkie Pie got her hooves on it, the structure would be unrecognizable.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A small crowd had gathered to watch the practice performances. Everypony putting on a show was on the crown’s — Index thought rather generous — payroll and had quickly agreed to make some of their practices public.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first show was about to begin when Index was assaulted by a small projectile shouting her name.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hello, Sweetie Belle,” Index said. She shot Lyra a victorious look who rolled her eyes.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey there, Index, Lyra,” Applejack called from behind her, trying to keep the other two Cutie Mark Crusaders in control. “It’s a bit of a surprise seeing you two together.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why is that,” Lyra asked?</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, Bon Bon came over this morning for some fresh apples. She looked troubled so I asked her what was wrong. She said that there was something weird going on between you two but didn’t know what.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh,” Lyra said, deflating. “I wonder what I should tell Bon Bon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applejack suddenly had a look of understanding. “Well, shoot. I didn’t know you’d gotten that far.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index raised a single eyebrow, a feat she admittedly had to magically modify herself to perform. “You have the wrong idea, Applejack.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What idea is that?” Sweetie Belle asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s the wrong idea so you don’t need to know,” Index replied.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Aw, come on. That’s not fair.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s totally fair.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applejack retrieved Sweetie from Index’s back and addressed Index, “If you say so.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index nudged Lyra with magic. “Wake up and agree before Sweetie Drops hears half-baked information.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh?” Lyra said, awoken from her thoughts. “Agree with what?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t really want to say it with the Cutie Mark Crusaders present,” Index said just loud enough for Applejack and Lyra to hear, but not quiet enough to seem like sweet nothings. “I heard what happened when they got a similar idea into their head with Cheerilee.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cheerilee? Oh!” Lyra blushed a bit. “No, no, no, no. You’re way off Applejack. We’re just training to fight an evil goddess with friendship.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra smiled as if she had just said made perfect sense and deserved no closer inspection.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Say what now? Afraid I don’t quite get the joke” — Lyra frowned — “but all the same its always good to see friendships bloss— Scootaloo!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo had wandered off with the other crusaders following. Applejack had run off to bring them back.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Were you involved in politics in the past?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sort of. How did you come to that conclusion?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Lying with the truth is a technique most ponies can’t get down, politicians included, but that’s were I see it most.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh. I should be more careful then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nah. I don’t think anypony will notice if you stay clear of Canterlot.” Index paused a moment before adding, “Good job, Lyra the Ever Honest.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Shut up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applejack returned with the Cutie Mark Crusaders in tow.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Where were you three headed?” Index asked Sweetie Belle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t get mad at her, but Scootaloo doesn’t really like you ever since I told her you were cooler than Rainbow Dash.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see. I’ll leave that debate up to you two. I’m pretty biased.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie was going to comment but a performer walked onto the stage and quieted the crowd.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first act was a play concerning a sordid affair between a young prince and his uncle. It was surprisingly well done without props or costumes. Even the Cutie Mark Crusaders found themselves enraptured despite most of the plot going right over their heads.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The next act was a manzai comedy show. Index didn’t enjoy this particular variety of comedy but everypony else seemed to be enjoying it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The next two acts were shorter. Mere previews of what they would perform later. One was a one-pony band that Applejack commented would put Pinkie’s to shame. The other was a bard. Index would have enjoyed his stories more if she hadn’t already analyzed them to death looking for well-hidden secrets.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ten minutes passed and Index worried that the one act she wanted to see was canceled. Really, Trixie was the only reason she had come.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then the explosion came.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie’s entrance was exactly what one might expect from somepony that introduces herself as ‘The Great and Powerful’.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Fireworks, lasers and mist were among the many features accompanying her appearance from nowhere on stage. The area around the stage was magically darkened, granting the effects power not possible during the day.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ponyville” — Trixie’s voice echoed across the crowd — “You have called and I have answered. I am the one and only. The Great and Powerful Trixie!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">More fireworks punctuated Trixie’s introduction.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">What followed was the most over the top, showboating display of illusionary and evocation magic ever.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was everything Index had hoped. Excluding property damage.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Unfortunately for Trixie, Index was a city pony and a unicorn for whom the act was tailored. Traits the rest of the crowd did not share.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The foals liked her well enough, except Sweetie, but the adults did not take the narcissism well. The earth ponies were especially displeased.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">From the rabble, it was Applejack that shouted first.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You think you’re so great? I’d bet everypony in Ponyville is twice the pony you are.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie turned into Applejack causing the real one to jump back in surprise.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After a few measured steps to test her balance, Trixie jumped to the ground and the foliage grew around her hooves. At least, it so appeared. The fake earth pony magic was exceedingly convincing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Great and Powerful Trixie accepts your challenge with the field leveled. Name your terms.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applejack fumbled, having not thought of something to compete in ahead of time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Apple Bloom interjected with the clarity of an outside observer, “How about your lasso skills, sis?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ah. That’s perfect! Thanks, Apple Bloom. Let’s have us a lasso competition. Most accurate shot wins.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Very well. Let the game begin!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie quickly quickly reorganized the stage to feature small pegs to lasso with accompanying obstacles. A lasso fell in front of Applejack and Trixie held one in her mouth already.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applejack jumped onto the stage after Trixie and the competition began. The first to miss a shot would be the loser. However, neither mare missed a shot and Trixie upped the difficulty by causing both targets and obstacles to move randomly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index could tell that Trixie was technically cheating, using magic to adjust her lasso mid throw to fly true. But, then again, it was monstrously unfair to challenge somepony to a competition of skill in which you were the best in town.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But really, Index just enjoyed the performance, even if the rest of the crowd didn’t understand.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soon, Trixie had raised the speed of the objects too high for Applejack to aim accurately and forced her to admit defeat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applejack came back to the crowd fuming leaving a re-Trixied Trixie on the stage.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Does anypony else dare challenge The Great and Powerful Trixie?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh no.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie Belle continued, “Index could wipe the floor with you!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And who is this Index?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She’s right here!” Sweetie gestured to Index. “She can take you on in anything!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie missed a beat, but then said, “Well? Name your terms.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I would love a magical duel in different circumstances, but at the moment I’m rather enjoying the show.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The rest of the crowd gasped, betrayed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Index, you can’t let her win!” Sweetie pleaded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. This mare needs taking town a peg.” Applejack said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was having fun,” Apple Bloom started, “but my sister needs avenging.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo said nothing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra laughed to herself.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine,” Index sighed. “How about a duel restricted to first year spells? Three points.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Very well.” Trixie banished the props from her last challenge leaving the stage bare. “Take your position.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index hopped onto the stage and she and Trixie walked to opposite ends.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When the first spells were flung, neither mare’s horn glowed.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was wrong about Trixie. She wasn’t just talented. She was brilliant.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Their fight had already lasted well past the time Trixie had available for her act, but nopony tried to interfere. Not even the next performers. The duel had slowly drawn more and more ponies across Ponyville until at least half of town not currently working had gathered. Even some ponies that were had come.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s biggest problem was the sheer number of illusion spells Trixie had at her disposal. Because it was easy to learn illusion cantrips, first years learned a lot of them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Trixie’s cutie mark attested, illusions were her specialty. If it wasn’t already obvious from her earlier performance, Trixie had spent years thinking of clever ways to apply illusions.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had to dodge or counter hundreds of potential threats, only a couple of which were real.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie also occasionally summoned obstructions to force certain movements and positions.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Except, sometimes they were fake and spells would pass right through it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first fake wall had gained Trixie a point.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of course, Index was no pushover, even with a highly restricted spell set.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Where Trixie favored overloading the senses with a flurry of illusions, Index opted for stealth spells that were difficult to detect.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As the battle wore on, Index even picked up a few of Trixie’s ideas and returned them in spades.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first time Index did this, she managed to score a point off a surprised Trixie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Both Trixie and Index grew physically tired over the fight and resorted to moving with telekinetic assistance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweat drenched them as they resorted to more and more exotic uses of their available spells.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Water summons were used to block fireballs.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Itching spells on nearby trees caused apples to fall en masse.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mending spells made the floor slightly uneven.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Somehow, fear was cast on the air creating small vacuums.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With enough power, even the opening spell was used to ‘open’ the floor below the duelers creating traps.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The stage was an aesthetic nightmare after accumulating collateral damage. Rarity would have fainted for real if she had been present.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Frustrated as another one of her spells flew off of Index’s shield, Trixie let out a burst of brute-force counter magic followed by several seeking spells directly in its wake.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With no first year spell to counter the oncoming dispel, Index leap through it crashing into another spell behind it, conceding a point to Trixie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Now with her polymorph dispelled — or an illusion applied depending on perspective — Twilight fired off two spells in quick secession at a mentally stunned Trixie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was a dirty trick skirting the edge of the rules. Polymorph was far from a first year spell. But Twilight already had it on at the start and Trixie was the one that dispelled it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight reapplied the polymorph, making the act look like she was dispelling an illusion. It wouldn’t fool Trixie, but Index had enjoyed herself and that was all that mattered at the moment.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie had finished her act with poise and grace. She had a reputation as a showpony to keep up. But after she had left in a puff of smoke, she had sequestered herself in her wagon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There had been ponies in the past that obviously didn’t like her act. Lots of them even. But never before had an entire crowd been so happy to see her lose.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">My act is fun…isn’t it?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For the first time since her expulsion, Trixie cried.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index almost turned around and left. She expected Trixie to feel a bit hurt, but not crying. Still, nopony else in town would do this and it needed to be done, and some part of her mind whispered <span style=" font-style:italic;">friendship point</span>.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With only a slight curse at her magically enhanced hearing, Index knocked on Trixie’s door and waited patiently.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose you may as well come in,” Trixie said as the door opened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index entered and dropped her polymorph once the door was closed. It had no use here.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, what does the oh-so-special Archmage Twilight Sparkle want with The Pathetic and Unwanted Trixie? Did Princess Celestia get bored with you and throw you out onto the streets? Oh, maybe you want to join my act. That would be just <span style=" font-style:italic;">wonderful</span>.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was going to come here to apologize—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t want to hear it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But I changed my mind and decided to thank you instead.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Seeing Trixie had no words for this, Twilight continued, “It’s been years since I had a duel without my life at stake. It was more fun than I remembered. Also, even if Ponyville doesn’t get it, I thought your act was fantastic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Great. Thanks. Was that it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I…suppose so.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then leave me be.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight idled where she stood, staring at the ground.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Beatrix” — Trixie winced as if she had forgotten her name — “…Trixie, why are you a showpony?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Leave.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight opened her mouth to speak again but Trixie beat her to the punch.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I said. Buck! Off!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie slammed open the door, reapplied the polymorph for Twilight, and threw Index out the door. A moment later the wagon was sealed as tightly as if the interior were another dimension.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index didn’t land with a thud, but a gentle fall.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Horse-feathers. That didn’t go well at all.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index pulled out some parchment and a quill and wrote ‘Need background check on Trixie (Beatrix) Lulamoon — Former student at Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns’.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sending off her message, Index returned to her day with Lyra.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sudden realization came, the secret revealed.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, no. This is going to be one of <span style=" font-style:italic;">those</span> dreams.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wait. Dream? By Star Swirl’s beard, I love lucid dreams!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight looked around and was disappointed to find nothing of interest. She was on a small grassy hill with a thin ring of trees around it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trying to focus on anything past the trees hurt. It didn’t hurt her eyes. Instead it hurt some part of her that was insisting the world ended at the trees.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Similarly, trying to move past the trees was met with rejection and more abstract pain.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Next she tried to reorder the cosmos at her whim to no avail. In all of her past lucid dreams, Twilight had been a goddess toying with her universe and loved every second of it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“This is a dumb dream.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Indeed it is,” a voice said somehow on the other side of the trees, past the edge of the world. “I shall try to make it more interesting.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Who’s there?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A pony sized figure emerged from the tree line opposite her and climbed to the summit where it waited.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight went to join it and as she grew closer more and more details faded into view. The visitor was a blue coated mare barely taller than Twilight with a pale mane and tail. She had the oddest black splotch of color around her moon shaped cutie mark.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then as Twilight was about to sit down, the mare’s wings and horn came into view.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon giggled at Twilight’s frantic backpedaling.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Giggling? That doesn’t seem right.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The banishment isn’t broken. Feel free to calm down. The only thing I can do to you in your dreams is talk you awake.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">There’s probably some questing rules that says don’t talk to the extremely probably evil goddess seeking to make her return. Buuut, then again, I really, </span>really<span style=" font-style:italic;"> want to. </span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight returned to the summit and sat across from Nightmare Moon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“This is a surprise.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My presence or my appearance?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Both I suppose. Although I was sort of anticipating the former.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I’ve watched enough of your dreams to know you’re probably curious, so I’ll explain. This is still your dream despite my intrusion. If your subconscious protests my presence too much, I’ll be booted out. This appearance is rather disarming, don’t you think?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose. Now that I think of it, have you been causing my nightmares?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I will admit a certain influence I may have had in my failed attempts to properly enter your dreams. But your horrors are your own. Some of them quite amusing. I didn’t know this, Pinkie Pie, was my ‘true queen’.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight blushed. Even if she was lying, it was still an mortifying dream to let Nightmare Moon see.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“P—Putting that aside. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Before we move on to that, I should point out that you missed one very important point when you proclaimed me insane. At least, from what I can gather in your dreams.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Which is?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When it was clear Nightmare Moon wasn’t going to answer, Twilight thought for a moment.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What would I have missed. She definitely spent a thousand years alone on the moon. She had a grudge when she was banished. I suppose Celestia could be lying about what happened, but that would be more than one detail. Alicorns don’t seem to be any more resistant to isolation if Celestia is a decent standard. I guess Nightmare Moon could have napped through it all. I don’t know enough about alicorn biology.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What did I miss? If this requires knowledge I don’t have then it’s hardly a fair question. What could she possibly tell me is missing?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh. Not missed, wrongly assumed.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You didn’t spend the thousand years alone.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right. It may be getting easier, but I have been able to enter dreams the whole time. Don’t tell my sister, but no small number of them were trysts.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was momentarily surprised to see steam rising from her in embarrassment before remembering she was in a dream.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon was rolling around laughing. “Oh, but you are easy to tease.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please tell me you’re not here just to humiliate me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Would you rather say I’m here to ask you not to use the elements?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That would be stupid.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Indeed, which is why I’m here to have fun. It’s very boring stuck as the— What was the term? The mare in the moon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can imagine. What did you have in mind?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, there seems to be only two things you—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have got to be joking.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nope.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You <span style=" font-style:italic;">can’t</span> be serious.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Even if I were lying, you wouldn’t get me to change my answer from simply <span style=" font-style:italic;">asking again</span>.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This is obviously a trap. I just don’t see what possible harm could come of her giving me information.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">But I might never get another chance to probe an alicorn’s knowledge unfiltered. Celestia always gets touchy on certain subjects.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">She gets touchy because she wants those things left secret and you shouldn’t pry.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">There are no secrets for me. Only truths not yet explored.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">There’s plenty of other truth that needs exploring. You can pass up this one.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No! We have to know!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why do you even want to talk to her? She’s just going to lie whenever its convenient.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">So what? We’d at least have half-truths to jump off of. “</span>Are you not even curious?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course I am. This is just a horrible idea.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, no it’s not. We might even be able to get a hint about our masterpiece.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon watched in amusement as Twilight argued with herself in circles, at first in her mind and then literally. Dreams did have a certain tendency to make focusing difficult and to produce odd effects.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon nudged both Twilights who responded in unison, “What?” Then realizing there was another Twilight, went into full panic mode.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Argh! I told you she was out to get us!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’re in a dream. I’m sure this is perfectly natural. We still need that information.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No! We! Don’t!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fillies—,” Nightmare Moon corrected herself, “filly, what’s this about a masterpiece?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“See! Now she’s interrogating <span style=" font-style:italic;">us</span>.” Suspicious Twilight turned to address Nightmare Moon. “How did you even find out about that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Your ‘internal debate’ is being spoken out loud.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh.” The Twilight’s looked at each other, both still valuing privacy, and huddled together like the gossiping mares they had seen in Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t you dare tell her about my research,” Suspicion hissed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And why shouldn’t I?” Curiosity asked. “I’ve been stuck on it for a <span style=" font-style:italic;">year</span> now. I don’t think it’s a problem I can solve without more knowledge of alicorns.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You are so infuriating. If you must ask her, wait until after we’ve blasted her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No! This can not wait!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s waited for a year already. It can wait another month.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And what if we mess up? What if this is the last time an alicorn will talk to us?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Suspicion had no words for this, but neither did Curiosity. Neither of them wanted to think about a world without Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Have you reached a conclusion?” Nightmare Moon asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes,” Curiosity began, moving towards Nightmare Moon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then Suspicion tackled her shouting, “No!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The two descended into a scuffle, oblivious to whatever Nightmare Moon was saying.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">On the hardest hit of the fight, Index woke up in bed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Being both sides of a brawl was now Index’s standard for stupid ideas.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Checking that Pinkie Pie was still asleep, Index teleported out of the room into an anonymous location in Sweet Apple Acres. She had two messages to send.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first was an order to the EIS (Equestrian Intelligence Service).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Most ponies didn’t even know Equestria had an intelligence division. Unlike other nations, Equestria literally had a shining sun goddess as their ruler that most everypony in it loved and everypony outside it feared. This sort of made the department seem superfluous.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And that was more or less true for internal affairs. Sure, the politicians constantly schemed and squabbled, but they all knew that trying to fight Celestia in force was futile. That’s why the agency focused almost exclusively on two things: espionage and covert protection.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">No matter how stable Celestia’s reign was, there would always be important ponies that needed protection.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Worse, many other nations took their fear of Celestia and used it to drive their ambition. It wouldn’t do to leave somepony that powerful unchecked after all.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index understood why Celestia never visited the front lines. Beyond the alicorn accord preventing her — and more recently Twilight despite protestations that she was, in fact, <span style=" font-style:italic;">not</span> secretly an alicorn — from doing so. Still, Twilight really wished Celestia would once and a while to remind the new generations to not mess with Equestria.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But, add a second goddess to the mix and all the rules changed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was no secret that most of the nobility hated Celestia almost as much as Index found them beneath contempt.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It made sense though. Celestia had been slowly eroding the privileges of nobility for centuries. Her more recent, and rather more flagrant, insult to the nobility was placing commoner ponies in the position of royal guard captain and the long unused position of archmage, Shining Armor and Twilight Sparkle respectively.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Shining could be dealt with. He was a typical upstart. No political connections. Strong influence in the centralized army but of little importance elsewhere. Sure he was a national hero and a prince by marriage, but that could be fixed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">No, what really ruffled their feathers this generation was Twilight. For all that she tried to ignore politics, the archmage was effectively Celestia’s coruler. Somepony the nobility had to suck up to and obey. Even some of the smarter ones might be willing to take a chance with eternal night just to remove Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">So Index’s order was simple. <span style=" font-style:italic;">Investigate </span><span style=" font-style:italic; text-decoration: underline;">EVERY</span><span style=" font-style:italic;">PONY and </span><span style=" font-style:italic; text-decoration: underline;">EVERY</span><span style=" font-style:italic;"> GROUP of influence for treason.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had one completely trusted contact within the EIS to whom she was sending this order. A pony whose career Index had personally helped develop, whose loyalty to Equestria was undebatable, and whose skills were undeniable.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This pony went by the name of Espionage, or Esp for Index. What his real name was, perhaps not even he knew anymore. It was the same pony she had sent her request for a background check on Trixie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Perhaps what Index liked best about Esp was how quickly he reacted and his impeccable timing. Just after the order was sent, Esp sent the documents concerning Trixie that had been gathered, documents that no doubt he had been wanting to send for some time, waiting for Index to be completely alone, along with another slip of paper.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Can Celestia be consulted on this?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Perhaps there were just a lot of things about Esp Index liked. He also knew that subtlety sometimes required leaving Celestia out of the loop.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Yes. She will have more details in approximately one minute.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mentioning that Celestia wouldn’t know for another minute was a detail Index would only ever need to mention to Esp.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Which brought her to her second message which would be delivered to Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Good news and bad news. Good news first. Your sister is not insane. Bad news, she has been dream-walking for a thousand years. If she still holds a grudge, our lax investigations into internal affairs will come back to bite us. Espionage is already on it and will likely be coming to you shortly. If he’s not already hiding in the shadows.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">No more than a minute later, Celestia responded with a scroll bearing only the words <span style=" font-style:italic;">Thank you</span>.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A warm feeling bubbled up within Index at Celestia’s reply. Celestia’s letters were always so elegant, even when time was a concern. Such a short response surely meant she was overwhelmed with relief and genuine hope of getting her sister back for the first time in centuries.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That warm feeling disappeared quickly as she read through Trixie’s file with increasing alarm.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index sent off another message to Esp who was likely now with Celestia. This one was encoded with Esp’s own carefully guarded spell so that only he could read it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Do not under </span><span style=" font-style:italic; text-decoration: underline;">any</span><span style=" font-style:italic;"> circumstances tell Celestia what was in Trixie’s file and if you haven’t mentioned it already, do not tell her there </span><span style=" font-style:italic; text-decoration: underline;">is</span><span style=" font-style:italic;"> such a file.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With the message hastily sent, Index returned to Trixie’s file once more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This is horrible. Why didn’t she ever say anything? No, I can guess. But how did everypony miss this? The resentment she showed makes a lot more sense now…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index burned the file. It should never again see the light of day.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Can I extract a Pinkie Promise from you?” Index asked. “No, forgive me. That’s not fair. I can’t do that, pre-friend or regular friend.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra looked on as Index paced. “What would I be Pinkie Promising anyways?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not to betray the cause. I don’t have Honesty so I still have some trust issues.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Must be frustrating. What’s happened that you’re suddenly even more paranoid?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I found out that Nightmare Moon is dream-walking. Actually, has been for her entire imprisonment.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see. I suppose that invalids the idea that she is insane and makes her easier to barter with.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Worse. She’s friendly and adorable.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh dear. And you’re worrying about me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s a statement of fact, not opinion.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sure. That’s what they all say. I’m not that different from you. I’ve read the old stories looking for truth. The protagonists always think the eldritch abomination is redeemed and cute. Then they find themselves with teeth around them.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see seapony stories are just as charming as they are.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Those were foal stories actually.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I almost want to take a trip to Aquastria just to experience the culture.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But then you remember you like being sane, right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, you’re right that a Pinkie Promise would be counter productive to building friendship. Still, I can remind you that I’ve been happily living in Ponyville for years. I doubt I will suddenly decide that I actually want a lot more out of life and team up with Nightmare Moon to get it. There’s plenty of other <span style=" font-style:italic;">risk-free</span>, legitimate ways for a reasonably powerful spellcaster to get what they want.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index relaxed a bit. Lyra made a lot of sense.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks. That helps. I have trouble thinking in panic mode. I could have half or more or Equestria up in arms in a month let alone any other plots Nightmare Moon could have laid. I can’t deal with all that. Celestia can’t deal with all that. The country will be flooded in blood. Then the world will freeze in an eternal night after as a cruel joke. I’d rather deal with Discord. He at least wanted to—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s furious pacing and ramble were broken by two hooves on her shoulders.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Calm. Down.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“R—Right. Calm. I can do calm. It’s just, we only have two bearers so far. We may even end up reverse ambushed and—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What part of calm down do you not get? Don’t make me go seapony on you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index opened her mouth which was forced shut by Lyra’s magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I take it you didn’t get much sleep last night which is making this worse for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index shook her head. She was the archmage of Equestria. Sleep was optional.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra just stared into Index’s eyes. Honesty even picked up nonverbal lies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Slowly, Index nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s what I thought. I would force you to bed now, but I imagine I’d have to knock you out with Nightmare Moon waiting on the other side.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index’s eyes widened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re kidding me! You didn’t even realize that? When was the last time you had a restful sleep? No nightmares.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The pressure on Index’s jaw released and she quietly said, “Maybe, nine or ten days. But the nightmares are just disruptive.” Index then continued more forcefully. “Besides, I’ve once gone a month with only an hour of sleep every three days. It’s no problem.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra looked thoughtful for a moment. “Was that month the period of time known as ‘The Great Griffon Retreat’?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nervously, Index nodded.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sleep More!” Lyra shouted. “I don’t care if you doom the world for sleep! Do it!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra took a deep breath while Index struggled out of her grasp only to trip and fall.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Look, you obviously manage well enough without normal amounts of sleep. Still, it doesn’t seem to be without side effects.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know. I usually try, but when time pressures grow I habitually sleep less and less. It makes me…edgy after a while.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, as long as you understand. If you must, talk to Nightmare Moon all night until she falls asleep.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Heh. I wonder what sleeping in another pony’s dream is like. I suppose you’d probably just fall out of it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, in reference to mentioning that you only have two bearers earlier, a thought occurred to me this morning. I’m sure it wouldn’t be hard to make it so nopony noticed, so why haven’t you just thrown the elements at everypony and see what happens.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because…” — Index remembered thinking of that — “I forgot.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You forgot?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah… I’ve sort of been blindsided by this whole friendship thing I guess. Putting the cart before the pony, if you will. Thank you for pointing that out. That’s something I can easily do partially sleep deprived. If you’ll excuse me for the day, I’ll get right to it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index left in a rush casting a small flurry of spells on elements pulled from nowhere.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh. I think Pinkie Pie is rubbing off on her.” Lyra watched Index canter off until she was out of sight. “…She forgot…”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Regardless of how bad of an idea it was, there was one pony that Index was practically threatening the elements to accept as a bearer. Index knocked on her still tightly sealed door to no effect.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie, I will spend all day if I must to tear apart your spells if you don’t let me in.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The intricate flow of magic surrounding the wagon remained undisrupted.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That cursed unicorn was coming back again. A hateful knock came at her door.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie, I will spend all day if I must to tear apart your spells if you don’t let me in.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Ha! I’m sure you will. If you want in you’ll have to work for it. That idiot’s probably dug into my past. If she says one ‘I’m sorry’ there won’t be a hole big enough to hide in for her.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie left the wards untouched and went back to reading her book, occasionally bolstering a spell or add one that was already torn down to make life more difficult for Twilight Sparkle. Trixie couldn’t replace them as fast as Twilight torn them down, but she could at least let some of her bitterness be released in the casting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After an hour of delaying Twilight, Trixie was finally down to her last ward. She could feel it being taken from her. Feel it being restructured. The contained explosion of magic as it was ripped apart, piece by piece.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For all that she fumed at Twilight Sparkle, Trixie knew the mare was brilliant and that made her feel so much worse. Picking apart her wards was just a small example of Twilight’s endless talents and achievements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Another knock came at the door as the last ward dissipated harmlessly into the magical background of Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Heh. Knocking on the door after you’ve torn down the walls. How polite.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie opened the door. “Congratulations. You’ve gained access to the lair of The Secluded Trixie. What reward do you want?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, if you’re offering rewards, there’s a certain spell I would love to cast on the phrase ‘The Great and Powerful Trixie’ but Celestia would kill me. You could take her wrath for me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie had been ready to lash out, but this was unexpected.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why is she joking?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What is it that you want with me? We’ve never even met directly before yesterday.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I want to try to deliver something to you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t want anything you have to give,” Trixie scoffed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know. But you’ll notice I said deliver. What I have is not mine to give or take, merely to find out who they can belong to.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cute. But it’s the same either way. Take your cursed invisible sphere things to somepony else.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You see, that’s exactly why I hope one of them will accept you. You’re brilliant. It’s time that was a reward for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie scowled. “So you did look into my past.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course I did. You threw me out and locked yourself up the moment I so much as mentioned it. You couldn’t put up a bigger sign screaming secret. Secrets are practically the bread and butter of powerful mages like you and I. Would you have acted any different?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No. That’s the only answer I could possibly give. That doesn’t make it right.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">From her chair, Trixie only grumbled in response.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Taking her quiet as acceptance, Index hovered the four remaining elements in front of Trixie, dropping the spells hiding them temporarily. There they stayed, waiting for Trixie to touch them and so be judged.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie stared at the simple spheres, examining them in detail without actually moving. They certainly didn’t look interesting. The polished surfaces were somehow dull and, from what could be seen inside, protected only gaudy necklaces.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Examining them over and over, Trixie looked for any traces of magic that could tell her what they do. So far as she could tell, they were inert lumps of junk.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And yet, as she spent more time with them, a sourceless song could be heard. It was so faint she probably wouldn’t have noticed if any other noise were present in the wagon. In fact, the wagon was absolutely quiet.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">When did she put up these wards? Is she that good?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie glanced at the clock on her wall and suppressed a gasp.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I’ve been sitting here for ten minutes!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie stole a quick glance away from the elements towards Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">She’s just been standing there this whole time… Staring…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie shook off the bothersome thought and returned to the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What are you? Why do you sing to me?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In response to her question, an overwhelming desire overcame her. Reaching out, her hoof just touched an element and the wagon flooded with light.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When the light faded, the singing stopped. A necklace was draped around Trixie’s outstretched hoof like a bracelet, her wand and stars cutie mark ornamented it as a gem with a blue color only slightly darker than her own.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Something told her this was a magical moment. Something told her there were only two words she could say that wouldn’t ruin it. Something told her she had to say them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index held the elements silently in front of Trixie who neither moved nor spoke. From a brief glance, she could tell Trixie was examining the elements in detail.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Great detail.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Almost like she was in a trance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index hurriedly put up the necessary wards to keep the light she just knew was coming from flooding all of Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie glanced up. Was she wrong? Index had been so sure that the elements were calling to Trixie in some way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But then, Trixie reached out for Laughter, slowly and gently. Index winced internally. Laughter would be invaluable to Trixie, but she could lose herself in it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The usual bright light erupted from Laughter, blinding Index and Trixie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index retrieved and stored the elements as the light died, leaving Laughter and Trixie in their own private world.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then, the two words Index least expected to hear came.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Some time passed before Trixie spoke again and broke Index from her stupor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What have you given me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That is The Element of Laughter. Part of a matched set called The Elements of Harmony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Laughter? My life is anything but funny.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You are free to interpret things for yourself. Know this though, as the only pony in town who could really appreciate your act, I think the element suits you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index continued, “Do you want to know what my first reaction was when I heard you were coming to town? It’s very rude.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie nodded ever so slightly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was absolutely giddy to have the mare who was expelled for blowing up no less than three rooms come to town. I was expecting quite a show in the disaster sense. Even when I was hanging out with the bearer of Honesty, I was mostly looking forward to watching you perform.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But then, what I got was a quite a show in the normal sense. It was only then that I realized I was looking forward to you messing up and I felt rather bad about it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Was that supposed to be comforting, or…anything really?” Trixie asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…I don’t know. I think I had a point going into that but sort of lost it along the way.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie managed a laugh at Index’s expense. “I guess that, at least, is funny.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m tired, alright.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then go. The Great and Powerful Trixie is feeling surprisingly well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Lyra said more or less the same thing when Honesty came to her. I suppose I would have too, if I had anypony to say it to. I think it’s normal to get a— Well, not a mood boost, but sort of a feeling of rightness around your element.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Before I leave though, three things.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“First, go talk to Lyra Heartstrings. She’ll be able to fill you in on the details of what’s going on in the cosmos.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why is it that something is telling me that was the right word choice?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s the second thing. Laughter has the standard set of powers you can get a list of from Lyra, but also has what amounts to a charisma boost. It can tell you what is a good idea to say to get certain effects. However you’re feeling that cosmos was the appropriate word is probably how Laughter is talking to you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wait, so why is it I can’t feel anything magical about this necklace? I don’t notice myself using magic passively either.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No idea. The elements are a mystery to Celestia as well. If there is place they came from, it is a secret long forgotten.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, third, and by far most importantly, be careful with your element. It is very dangerous to the bearer mentally. If you overuse its ability you will come to depend on it. This is a risk of all the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Except Magic I suppose. Magic’s sort of a one-trick pony.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Your element is in particular troubling. You can lose your sense of self if you let it do all of your talking and thinking for you. It…has a history of making a bad situation worse. It was in small part responsible for the fall and banishment of Nightmare Moon whom you will hear of from Lyra.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, if that starts happening, I can give The Element of Laughter back, right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index shook her head. “I can forcibly take its physical form from you, and keep it from you, which will prevent you from using your abilities. However, it will remain part of you until the day you die. Or if you betray Laughter in some way, which I would not suggest doing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“On a personal note, I have not enjoyed being apart from my element, even though it is needed elsewhere at my own order. It’s just a small annoyance now, but I imagine the feeling gets much worse with time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index watched Trixie stare lovingly at Laughter, knowing she already understood.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Any other questions? Otherwise, I’m off.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Just one. If you think I’m brilliant, what do you think you are?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A pregnant silence enveloped the wagon. Index’s awkward shuffling told Trixie exactly what Index was trying to say.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That is one question that I really need Laughter to answer with any tact. If I were eighty years older, I would say, ‘I too, am brilliant.’ Perhaps…it would be enough to say there’s a reason why I had an informal education.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index retreated hurriedly, taking her dwindling wards with her. Trixie remained in her chair where she sat the entire time. The book she had been reading before lay forgotten by her side.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie definitely still resented Twilight Sparkle. Yet, staring at Laughter, she found it hard to. Maybe, just maybe, things would be better in the future.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was happy with how things worked out with Trixie. She had her concerns with Trixie having Laughter, but things should be okay.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The rest of the day Index spent nudging the hidden elements up against everypony she ran into, dropping the wards when the elements made contact for less than a millisecond.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After testing nearly every pony in Ponyville proper, Index came to the conclusion that these three elements were just being stubborn. Expanding her search, Index ventured out into the farm houses.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Frustrated again after exhausting the homes out of town, Index left the Apple home.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Surely </span>one<span style=" font-style:italic;"> of them should have been fine. There were like, fifty at that reunion.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I guess the point of coming to Ponyville was to get ponies already in friendships so grabbing out of town Apple relatives would be a bad idea. Now that I think of it, that just makes Trixie an even worse idea.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I guess Laughter made its choice. Probably wouldn’t have wanted anypony in Ponyville anyways. Just like these stupid elements.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Maybe there needs to be a connection of some sort between Magic’s bearer and the other elements. I could go back to the Pinkie Challenge of making friends with every pony…but that sounds awful.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Two ideas came to Index’s mind, one of which she immediately censored away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I guess I could test the foals…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Maybe I could get my own apprentice out of the deal…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What’s up with that cloud? It looks soft.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Ahead and a bit to her right, Index could make out a lonely cloud suspiciously low in altitude. A small patch of rainbow hair hung over the edge.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Isn’t that that weird library pony? Rainbow Dash if I’m making the right connection. Hmm. Sounds like a deep and meaningful connection to me.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Warded as it was, when Loyalty touched the sleeping pegasus and took its proper form, it did not become a second sun in the dwindling twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index face-hoofed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I need more than five data points. If the elements think bumping into a pony is a deep and meaningful friendship, I don’t know why I’m even here.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sigh…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Do I even want to deal with her right now?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No. I’ll come back tomorrow.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">After I sleep and deal with Nightmare Moon.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Maybe she’ll even find me. I hear she crashes into ponies a lot.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was ready for bed, and Pinkie was not around. It was barely past sunset after all. Pinkie would be out partying deep into the night as usual.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was just one question Index wanted answered before drifting off to sleep.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Can Nightmare Moon be in more than one dream at a time?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Several minutes later, the reply came.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">In the past, my sister has only been able to walk in one dream at any time. However, she could bridge dreams together enabling large crowds to congregate.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I suspect her dream walking is her only available ability and certainly only with great difficulty. Still, with but a single talent to exercise for so long, she would be the only one who could tell you how it has developed.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That was good news. If Index kept Nightmare Moon occupied the entire night, there would be less or no time for her to make mischief among the other bearers. Or the rest of Equestria.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight found herself once more on her dreamy hill. Nightmare Moon had yet to appear so Twilight simply waited at the summit, pondering whether she could go to sleep on the warm, soft grass.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the attempt, she noticed that nothing had changed from the last dream. Perhaps this realm was static, unaffected by even the strongest forces. Now that she thought about it, during the attempt to leave the hill last night she had stepped on several flowers that popped right back into place.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Without the frustration of being unable to leave nor being unable to control the dream, Twilight found the place actually was pleasant. An ethereal feeling hung over the world and the endless sky above glowed in the reds and oranges and violets of twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The way the light played with the sparse clouds was stunning. Each one added an extra bit of detail to the otherwise empty sky, creating an inverted landscape.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was then that Twilight began to wonder just whose dream this was. Celestia’s explanation suggested it was her dream, but this place was very out of character for Twilight, though she was finding it hard to care.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Perhaps her subconscious was trying to tell her something.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Perhaps dream walking forced some sort of stable, symbolic dream.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Perhaps Nightmare Moon was just messing with her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Speaking of the which, the mare in question was sitting peacefully next to Twilight for who knew how long now. But that was okay, there was a serenity in this world that made her not care. Discord, god of chaos, could have been next to her for all she cared. Nothing would upset her here. Not this time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey,” Twilight said, “did you do anything to this world? It’s so harmonious.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon giggled. “I think you’ve had enough distilled zen.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No.” Twilight somehow managed to relax herself even more as she replied. “One can never get too much bliss…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Have you heard the tragedy of The Muffin Mare?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight shook her head. “I’m not sure I want to right now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Muffin Mare baked muffins so delicious that they induced a state of pure bliss similar to what you’re feeling now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And everypony loved her and somepony important to her became addicted resulting in something horrible happened,” Twilight finished for Nightmare Moon, not annoyed, just distracted from ‘pure bliss’. “I’m well aware of narrative structure. Especially when they are delivering Aesops with all the subtly of manticore.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You do get the point though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Taking a huge breath only possible in the dream world, Twilight gave the longest sigh of her life. “I hear some noise nearby; dear love, adieu. Anon, Nightmare. Sweet blissfulness, be true. Stay but a little, I will come again.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nightmare Moon tried, really tried, but the melodrama was too much for her and she fell apart laughing until it hurt.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That hadn’t been quite the reaction Twilight was looking for, but it would do.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sorry,” Nightmare Moon apologized, “but I find it hard to believe you of all ponies would spout off anything poetic, let alone a quote from a story of tragic love.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Bah. When I was a filly, Celestia practically forced those plays through my ears in a vain attempt to get me to appreciate such art. Admittedly, some of them were enjoyable and nothing is more important to a researcher than a good memory.” Twilight thought for a moment, then added, slightly grinning, “Especially one enhanced further by magical assistance. Makes it easy to quote things.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, to answer your original question, I have done nothing. You just stopped magically interfering with your sleep and crashed. You’ll probably be out for more than half a day in a deep sleep. It’s making your dream feel particularly intoxicating to you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What about you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, it is affecting me a little. I might be willing to do something a bit rash.” Leaning in, Nightmare Moon asked, “Do you want make this my latest tryst?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After last night, Twilight had prepared herself for teasing, wanting to give back as much as she got. Tonight would be different. Hopefully.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s my dream, Nightmare Moon. I think that would make it <span style=" font-style:italic;">my</span> tryst.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm… Yes, I could live with that.” Nightmare Moon nuzzled Twilight’s neck as she replied. A certain sensual power entered the alicorn’s voice, almost like a Want It Need It spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight froze up. If she tried to take the joke any farther, she’d probably explode. Still, she hated to lose.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But then, the wing came. It pulled her close, and in her ear, Nightmare Moon whispered, “Please, call me Luna,” in that same inviting tone and that was just too much. Twilight scrambled out of Nightmare Moon’s embrace and tumbled a couple meters down the hill.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ha! When I was a filly indeed. You still are a filly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was still recovering from the fall and reeling in her chagrin, but managed to squeak out, “Adulthood is not measured by how much flirtation you can tolerate!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight would have been glad if Nightmare Moon had made some quip or something but instead she just gazed down at Twilight with pitying eyes. It was exasperating despite Twilight knowing she was right and that that featherheaded alicorn was just trying to get under her coat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was beginning to wonder if Celestia would even want this creature back. Whatever sentimental value it held, it didn’t seem to be worth the trouble. Maybe the elements would fix that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Have you calmed down now, little filly?” Nightmare Moon asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight wouldn’t dignify the question with a real response. Returning to the top of the hill would have to do.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was serious about calling me Luna though,” Nightmare Moon said once Twilight reached the hilltop. Twilight’s raised eyebrow prompted Nightmare Moon to explain. “It’s an epithet, not a name. I have no idea what lunkhead first came up with it, but despite <span style=" font-style:italic;">a</span> <span style=" font-style:italic;">lot</span> of effort on my part, it stuck. I have no interest in that happening again now that everypony has forgotten it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose I can give you the courtesy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excellent! Now, I am very much interested in what we were talking about last night. From what you said, somehow I meet some sort or prerequisite to provide insight. And I do hope you can keep your mind in one piece this time. You won’t wake up from a mere scuffle tonight and it would be so terribly awkward if you split.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">At least she isn’t suggesting we create a harem filled with myself — </span>Twilight face-hoofed — <span style=" font-style:italic;">and now she’s gotten me thinking about that nonsense.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We might be able to work out an information trade on that. Keep in mind that I could just ask Celestia for the information I need. You will need to bring a lot to the table if you want more than superficial details.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh? And yet you either haven’t or she failed to answer you. I wonder why? I do love the scent of a secret…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Brushing the inquiry aside, Twilight asked, “I trust you know Star Swirl and his research?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight, I’m ageless but I’m not <span style=" font-style:italic;">that</span> old.” Twilight rolled her eyes. “Fine. Yes, I’ve personally read through a vast amount of the remaining scraps of his research. I suppose that means you’ve found a new piece. And you haven’t told my dear sister yet. That’s <span style=" font-style:italic;">very</span> interesting. I don’t see how it would be <span style=" font-style:italic;">your</span> masterpiece though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, the research was abysmally documented. In practice, I was given a starting point and had to reinvent everything. I also may have made a number of improvements but I have several thousand more years of magical research to draw upon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose I could call that a masterpiece for a typical scholarly mage, which you are not.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight couldn’t help but smile at the obvious flattery laced with demanding expectations.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, well. The key here is this is Star Swirl’s only unfinished spell. Or at least the only known one, but from what we know of him, it is unlikely he ever left another one unfinished.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So why was this one left unfinished?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because it killed him when he tried to cast it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Huh. I always assumed he died of magical failure in extreme old age.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Having thoroughly developed a similar situation to the actual events to present, Twilight explained with carefully chosen words. “It’s the opposite actually. The spell was too magically dense and blew up in his face. That’s the crux of the issue. I can’t figure out how to hold the magic together.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Some unicorns look at solidified magic in awe and fear. Rightly so, since a minor mistake would cause their death in an explosion of random magical effects. However, solidified magic can not be condensed past a certain density or it explodes. Star Swirl’s spell used a vast quantity of solidified magic — perhaps more than remains in the world today which is an entirely different problem — and compacted it all into one tiny area.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“As might be expected, the result was explosive. Fortunately, the explosion was… I guess you could say contained, so the world didn’t break into pieces. I suspect this was still long before solidified magic was actually studied. The fact that Star Swirl had any sense to put up such safeguards is only a bit short of a miracle. Hmm, I’m going off on a tangent here.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Back to the point, there’s only one thing ever spoken of that has ever surpassed the density limit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight stared meaningfully at Luna who had already figured out where the conversation was going. “…Alicorns…” Luna said softly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right. I’m very interested in how you do it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see…” Luna was bitting her lip and wore a very troubled expression. “You certainly wouldn’t have gotten an answer from Celestia. Whatever our differences, we agree this is not a secret the world should hear. What does this spell do that you would risk destroying the planet to cast it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That information I will not divulge until after it is cast at which point it would be obvious. I’m not particularly eager to let this knowledge out. Possibly for the same reasons you don’t want to tell me the alicorn secret.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Also, it would be the absolute worst to be scooped. The spell can only be cast once in my lifetime.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can at least tell you it’s not morally objectionable to any reasonable philosophy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“’Reasonable philosophy’?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, anything not too far out there. Like one that believes everypony should die or should be mindlessly obedient to one puppet master. That kind of stuff. I could Pinkie Promise not to tell anypony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What is a Pinkie Promise?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Explaining would require a lot of background exposition. I would love to just hoof over my research notes, but—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You can if you remember them well enough.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How? I tried bending the cosmos to my will yesterday and that didn’t work. At all.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, there is a certain trick to it. It would be worse than Discord joining the dream if dream worlds were changed willy nilly at the whim of the dreamer.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“When I first forced you to enter your dream world, a small stable land was created out of some strong memory or desire. For some ponies it’s a place of strong sentiment. For others its a place they long for: their home, a library, a palace. For you…well, I have no idea. You should try finding what about this place is particularly calming or enjoyable and work from there.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“From the look, I can guess you already have an idea. No doubt from your ‘sweet blissfulness’” — Luna chuckled — “helping you out.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight nodded. It was definitely the twilight. It was somehow fitting for a unicorn inspired by Celestia’s control of the sun to want the twilight that was her namesake.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, if you want to ‘reorder the cosmos’ you must first enter a calm, neutral state. Not happy, not angry, not unattached, just at peace. You must accept this dream for what it is and then you move it to a new state.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“As a side note, this is your dream world and it is stable. If you were to write a novel in here it would remain unchanged forever unless you, or a visitor like me, modified it. Unfortunately, you will have no better recall of it in the waking world than normal so this is not a way to cheat your memory and have a library in your head. At least, not one available outside of your dreams.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds incredibly useful for keeping memory charm proof records and diaries. Can I learn to enter this world on my own without you dragging me into it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna nodded. “Only I can dream walk but anypony can enter their own dream world. The trick is to learn to lucid dream and then deny the dream to enter this space.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds hard…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It is. Especially if you keep messing with your sleep.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’d be much less of a reason to if I can be productive during my sleep as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I wrote a book on the subject long ago. I’d bet the Canterlot Archives still have at least one copy. I’ve run into a few dreamers that have read it over the centuries although none lately. If not, I’m sure my sister would have one tucked away somewhere.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At the mention of Celestia, a thought struck Twilight. “Why haven’t you visited Celestia?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The question hung over the hill like a lull in a party. Luna looked like she didn’t have an answer, or at least didn’t know how to put it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My sister…enjoys…natural dreams. When I first started walking the realm of sleep, I learned not to enter hers. She has particularly nasty defenses to her dreams being disrupted. If we can, I’d like to move away from my trauma. Let’s try summoning your notes about Pinkie Promises.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight acquiesced and returned to the much more comfortable position she had earlier staring at the sky. Letting her cares go, she tried to engulf herself in the serenity she had before.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Calm. I can do calm. I get bonuses to calm tonight.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight focused on appreciating the beauty of the twilight she wanted. Once more gazing at the luminous clouds that almost seemed to have colors she had never seen before. The gradient of the sky that had no discernible source of light. The slow drift of clouds that never moved, a phenomenon Twilight was eager to investigate but would probably have to write off as dream logic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Slowly she drifted back into that wonderful state of euphoria that was somehow different from the regular buzz of happiness.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She saw this world for what it was. It was a small land of isolation, but filled with comforts and potential. It was an empty world to build upon and the only troubles were the ones she chose to bring.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was a good world.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But it needed some research notes; that would make it better.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight taxed her memory, seeking to recreate <span style=" font-style:italic;">A Study in Pinkie</span> as faithfully as possible. And just like that, the papers were before her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With less effort than before, Twilight left her blissful state and examined the papers. It wasn’t a word for word replication — somehow Twilight knew despite the papers being pulled from her memory — but the spirit was there.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She gave the notes to Luna. “This is quite a large stack of papers and we can’t cheat with magic in here…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight shrugged. “You’ll just have to do it that old fashioned way then. I can amuse myself with this world while you do that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna pouted but began reading through the giant stack of papers anyways while Twilight returned her attention to reordering the dream world.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was so much a pony could do without the limitations of logic, not that the dream world didn’t seem to have its own strange interpretation of how a universe should run. Still, before Twilight tried out anything too mind-boggling, she intended to try her hoof at construction.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">First, the hill was too small. Twilight expanded the hill to be several times wider and taller. The circle of trees retreated and now there was room to unpack.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">One thing Twilight always felt Canterlot lacked, being situated on a mountain, was a moat. Sure they were completely useless against any foe but earth ponies, but there was something about them that Twilight loved. Just inside the ring of trees, Twilight placed a wide moat that was impossibly deep, perhaps even bottomless.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Just behind the moat, came the wall made of a smooth stone with several small towers and battlements. It was a rather short and stout wall, mainly for decoration. Twilight added eight evenly placed gates and bridges that would allow entry and passage over the moat. Not that there was anything on the other side yet.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Next, she turned her attention to the hilltop where she and Luna sat. Luna hadn’t had quite the right impression of Twilight. Twilight appreciated art and symbolism as much as the next pony, she just found it frivolous when there were better things to be doing and more functional ways to do things. But in the dream world it was easy to put brush to canvas and have a work of art that worked just as well as any other design. That was why Twilight had decided on building a tower.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Not an ivory tower. That would have been in poor taste. Besides, she was always partial to to amethyst and dream amethyst was a better building material than diamond.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For now, Twilight was satisfied with a ten story tower, plus the roof and a couple basements. Each floor was empty but she had ideas for what to put in them. A doorway inset into the wall of each floor opened directly to the desired destination floor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first floor Twilight reserved for a small edge of the world — Luna said it was easiest to come and go from the edges — much like the ring of trees. On this edge she placed a door. Somehow, the door always faced a pony in the room but never moved.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had long ago been frustrated by trying to understand the waking world’s geometry but she wondered if the dream geometry she was building was even consistent. At least her world didn’t have a sun and moon that disappeared every twelve hours and needed to be manually raised and set.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">No matter how inspiring the act of raising the sun was, Twilight still felt it was odd that it needed to happen at all since the sun drifted on its own until it needed to be set.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Putting her frustration aside, Twilight regained her calm and went up to the second level. Twilight filled out the second level with a dreamy kitchen and dinning table. Food and drink could be pulled from the pantry or cold storage as wanted or raw ingredients could be fetched for a home cooked touch.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of course, there was no need to eat or drink in the dream world, but they could still be pleasurable acts. They were also consequence free which Celestia would probably have loved if she gave it a chance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight went for a cup of tea before starting the next floor but then realized she was a unicorn and utterly lacked the fine hoof or wing control of earth and pegasus ponies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In response, Twilight enabled general use of telekinesis in the universe. It was probably something she should have done right away, but when your shaping a world in your own image the minor details can slip through your hooves.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight grabbed her tea and moved up to the third floor. Here the first thing she did was insist that it was infinitely deep and wide and a couple stories tall. On the wall next to the door, Twilight plopped a few token decorations and started building a library of empty shelves.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The floor was divided into two sub-floors. The top one had glass walls and rails and was filled with as many bookshelves as the floor below. Overhangs let the brave jump over the railing to the floor below. Every so often, Twilight would thrown down a lounge area for reading, writing or just taking tea.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If one were to walk forever, this library floor would continue on with simple generating functions creating more library as it was needed. It was all very impressive but the only thing Twilight had to put in here at the moment was <span style=" font-style:italic;">A Study in Pinkie</span>.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was also very unnecessary. Twilight designed the library to be auto-sorting and had a small box that would retrieve any stored book just by wanting the book and reaching in. The shelves upon shelves were mostly just for the beauty that rows of books could bring to the room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">One part Twilight particularly planned to make use of was the small diary room. She designed it so that any books taken in there could only be read or removed by the pony to bring the in. Or herself. It was her dream after all.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Overall, she was proud of her work and how quickly she put it together. For now, Twilight would just enjoy her tea and maybe make another book while she waited for Luna to finish reading and show up.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was a couple chapters into her knockoff Darking Do novel — which she marked as such in case she ever word-for-word copied the original — when Luna entered the library with a look of absolute terror on her face.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A sudden realization overcame Twilight. “You went into Pinkie’s dream!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna nodded, shakily, as she collapsed onto a couch.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In a cold, hard whisper, Luna said, “Never again. That was worse.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Worse? Worse than what?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Tia’s.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, wow. I guess she wasn’t lying about Celestia traumatizing her. This is not a step in the right direction for Luna…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… Do you need anything?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ju… Just time. Didn’t linger.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight nodded and quickly left and returned with some Apple Family Cider she had managed to taste at Cheerilee’s. She was going to bring hot chocolate, but knowing Pinkie, it was probably part of the problem.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Here,” Twilight said, proffering the drinking.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna took the drink and sampled it before wolfing it down, eyes faintly sparkling.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is this the Apple’s cider?” Luna asked, her trauma slightly banished by the world’s greatest drink. “I can’t believe they’re still making it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re lucky. I only managed to get a small sample recently. I wouldn’t have known about it at all otherwise. I was told it could cure every woe, but I had assumed that was more of a hyperbole.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’d appreciate it if you would fetch more.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t worry, that bottle will never empty.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna stared at the bottle and then looked around the library, noticing that there was no end in sight. A single lonely book sat on a nearby table.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“This is quite impressive. Most ponies never adapt to the lack of structure in the dream world, let alone thrive in it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I think my view on magic is probably helping. I see magic more as breaking the rules than as the way the world is. It’s backwards, but that helps me with keeping my creativity up. I’m just doing the same here, but much more easily and flagrantly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose that makes sense.” Luna took a long drink from the cider and gave a huge, satisfied smile. “This cider has always hit the spot.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sooo…” Twilight started, intending to broach the obvious subject.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna sighed, but answered. “I understand why you think she’s some kind of Discord substitute. I don’t really know what to think of her myself. I’ll try investigating a bit more later but I doubt I’ll get anything more than you can from dreams.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“As for the other matter, I will ruminate on revealing the secret of alicorns, but I can tell you now I would need to know more about why you want it. Along with assurances that you will not destroy the world with it. I don’t want to move back to the moon after getting out.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose that’s fair. So what do you want to do with the rest of the night? I was thinking about installing a pool that’s <span style=" font-style:italic;">actually warm</span> in the basement. Maybe think about what else to conjure from the æther.”</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight prepared to conjure the powers of an all-powerful, pool-desiring deity and she and Luna left for the basement.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">“I’m your friend. Perhaps your only friend. Certainly the only one willing to see you through your folly. It’s time you told me.”</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index awoke a few hours short of lunch. Luna had been right about how long she would be out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">First things first. Let’s go pick up that dream book.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index got out of bed and brushed her mane out all at once to banish her only slightly worse than usual bed head. After a brief magical shower, Index felt presentable for the day.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index built up power for a quick trip to the Canterlot Archives when she spied Loyalty lying on the ground next to her saddlebag. Generosity was lying nearby having rolled across the floor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Whoops, probably should have stored those last nig—evening.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index swept up the two elements she spied and placed them back in her portable pocket. Next she picked up and stored her saddlebags which seemed to have let Kindness escape as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index looked all over the floor and under the beds and any other nook Kindness could have rolled off to but couldn’t find it. She could summon Magic and then summon Kindness, but that was a little too heavy hoofed for her taste. It was unfortunate that the elements didn’t have a magical field she could track.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then the horrible thought Index had yesterday before Loyalty approved of Rainbow Dash came back to her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What if Pinkie has it? Oh n—yes! Luna and I are both traumatized by her, but Luna had it worse. Finally somepony useful without friendship problems! I can work with this.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Skipping around the room and down the stairs in joy was a new experience for Index, but things were just going so very right. She just got a tactical advantage, she built a magical dream world up from scratch, she had a lead on a book that would teach her to enter the dream world, she had a chance of getting the information she desperately needed for her research. It had been a good night and morning.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good Morning!” Index sang into the kitchen. Mrs. Cake was pulling out a batch of cookies from one of their many ovens while Mr. Cake was mixing dough for several batches of blueberry muffins.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re certainly chipper this mourning,” Mrs. Cake said. “What’s got you in such a good mood?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can’t find a necklace,” Index said, smiling as brightly as before.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And that’s good?” Mr. Cake asked and Index nodded. “It wasn’t golden with a green balloon-shaped emerald on it was it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index squealed with delight. “Does Pinkie have it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sure does, sugar,” Mrs. Cake answered. “She was really excited about it for some reason. She ran out into town showing to show it off to everypony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mr. and Mrs. Cake looked to each other as Index left and shrugged.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index made a quick trip to the restricted Canterlot Archives and was back in Ponyville. Apparently Celestia had put a blanket ban on Luna’s books and never got around to seeing if any where troublesome.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">So, one <span style=" font-style:italic;">Entering the Dream Realm</span> heavier, Index started on her search for Pinkie Pie. This was proving to be far more difficult than it should have been.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Everypony had seen Pinkie. In fact, everypony had seen Pinkie at least twice. That was the trouble. Pinkie had been everywhere in Ponyville and there was too much noise in when ponies thought they saw her to chart any kind of path.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">So Index had a few options. She could head back to the Sugarcube Corner to find something to trace Pinkie with. On the other hoof, she could cheat. Loyalty had already been awakened so a quick explanation to Rainbow Dash on how to use it would let them find Kindness instantly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After asking around, Index determined that Dash would either be lounging around on a cloud somewhere or be extremely difficult to find.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index looked up. There were only a hoofful of clouds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Floating up into the sky, Index spotted a small rainbow in a far off anonymous cloud and headed that way. Sure enough, that small rainbow was a sleeping Rainbow Dash.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index cast a cloud walking spell and poked Dash awake.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wha…” Dash said sleepily. “Who are you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ll get to that soon. I need you to help me find Pinkie Pie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rubbing her eyes, Dash noticed she was talking to a unicorn. And she was on a cloud.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How did you get up here? How are you still up here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Magic and more magic. Levitation and a cloud walking spell specifically. Nothing too fancy.” Index pulled Loyalty from nowhere, much to Dash’s surprise. She then tossed it carelessly to Dash who managed grab hold of it with her wing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s this for?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s your magical necklace.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um, that’s great and all but I don’t really like jewelry. And you didn’t really answer my question.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It will help us find Pinkie Pie. It’s magic remember. Just put it on and, I don’t know, try thinking about where Pinkie is. I’d rather not explain everything twice in one day.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Sure…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash put on the necklace and squinted her eyes. In a moment, Dash looked like she had something.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I think I’m feeling something. Kind of a bunch of tingling feelings. The strongest one is over towards Applejack’s.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cool. Let’s go get her. Then I can explain about that necklace after we pick up a couple other ponies.” Index floated back down to the ground with Dash following behind curiously but still confused.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right, then. Lead the way if you would,” Index requested and Dash obliged.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, aren’t you that one pony that dueled with Trixie? That was awesome! I mean, not as awesome as me, but pretty close.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie wasn’t bad herself either.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I guess, but she’s kind of annoying.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dash, she’s a showpony. True, it seems she kind of acts that way all the time, but it is entirely natural that she would act like that when performing. Even more so since her act is based on dazzling the audience. She’s still a performer off stage and it would ruin the act a bit if she didn’t keep it up. The over-the-topness just makes the show better.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Wonderbolts aren’t like that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Wonderbolts’s performances involve no speech. Besides, they are primarily a military group. The shows they put on are just a side project since Equestria is usually very peaceful. Besides that, with few other exceptions, Captain Spitfire and Lieutenant Soarin are really the only decent ones on the team.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Whoa! Time out! You <span style=" font-style:italic;">know</span> the Wonderbolts?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not intimately, and mostly just Captain Spitfire, but I have at least met everypony on the team.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, dear Celestia! This is the best day ever! Can you get me their autographs?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I certainly could, but I don’t think that’s what you really want.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“C—Can you let me meet them?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t think that’s it either. I think you want a tryout. From what I hear of you, I’m surprised they haven’t scouted you yet.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was reasonably certain that Dash only hear a couple words after tryout before flying around in an an explosion of excitement that culminated in a tight hug.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’re the best pony ever!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash returned to flying nearby Index but it was clear she was still tingling with excitement and wanted to zoom all over the sky. Index couldn’t help remembering herself when Celestia’s letter arrived when she was eight. That is, herself after she woke up from fainting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, are we still heading in the right direction?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash took a long time to calm down and concentrate, but shook her head. “If these tingles are correct, Pinkie’s probably in the orchard somewhere nearby. I’ll fly up and take a look.” Flying high, Dash called out, “They’re over there!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index and Dash walked — Sweet Apple Acres was a strict no flying zone enforced by apple projectiles — past rows of appleless trees towards ones that still had fruit today.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soon, Applejack bucking apple trees came into view with Pinkie Pie buzzing around her trying to get more of her attention than a simple one or two word response.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Before Dash or Index got a word off, Pinkie spotted the two of them and was on them in a second.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, Dash! Hey, Index! This morning I was waking up and Index was still asleep and then I hit my hoof on this sphere thing Index left lying around and then there was this bright light and I found this!” Pinkie held out Kindness for them to see. “I figured it was yours but it has my cutie mark on it and it’s just too cute! I had to show it to everypony in town!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pinkie,” Index tried to get a word in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I saw another one on the ground but it had a shape more like the one Rainbow Dash has on right now! Are these a matched set or something? Are we super special best friends now?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pinkie,” Index tried again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And I keep getting these weird feelings when I’m wearing this! Like another set of emotions or something! It’s so cool! Although a lot of times it felt like annoyance and that was almost annoying because I never get annoyed but it wasn’t because I don’t.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pinkie!” Index shouted.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie stood stiff in a salute but was clearly having difficulty holding it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No going off the edge with what I’m about to tell you. Can you do that, Pinkie?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay. The necklace is yours to keep but we need to talk about it with some other ponies for a while.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie tried. It was obvious she did, but she went off the edge anyways with thank yous and ideas for several thank you parties. This was reminding Index why she was so afraid of Pinkie but if she just looked away, she could pretend nothing interesting was happening.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dash, the next pony I need you to find is Trixie. She’s probably in her wagon but having you lead is easier than roaming blindly.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really? Don’t tell me she has one of these necklaces too.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She does. Try not to be mean.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ugh. Fine. She’s…over this way.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I call to order the first meeting of the majority of the bearers of The Elements of Harmony,” Index said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had gathered Pinkie, Dash, Lyra, and Trixie — with a bit of difficulty — and teleported the group off to an anonymous location for privacy. There were a few trees around, but mostly the area was hilly with wild, untamed grass.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A quite application of magic plowed out a small area for their meeting and additional furnishings were provided. Index was feeling particularly theatric so she created a round table with six impressive stone chairs with elegant cushions Rarity would have died for. A minor roofing was provided as well to keep the sun from wearing the group down.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie raised her hoof.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Yes?” Index said hesitantly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why do you not have a necklace like the rest of us?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A good question. I actually have a tiara but it’s being used elsewhere at the moment.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie raised her hoof again and waved it around.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You don’t have to raise your hoof Pinkie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why are there six chairs?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because there are supposed to be six of us but one of use hasn’t been located yet.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Would tonight be a good night for an elements party?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… I don’t have any problems with that. Does anypony else? No? Sure then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, why did we come out—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Will you just ask the obvious question, Pinkie!” Rainbow Dash yelled.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okey dokey. What kind of cake do you like?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Argh! What are we doing here?” Dash asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, the big idea is there’s an evil goddess coming that’s more powerful than our own alicorn and the only way to stop her is to re-sanitize her with the elements of harmony. The elements of harmony require six bearers to be at full strength, we are five of them, and they run on the power of friendship so we all have to buddy up if we want to live past the Summer Sun Celebration. Questions?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">While Dash and Pinkie were absorbing the nonsense Index had just spewed, and Lyra laughed at how poorly that was delivered, Trixie said, “So when you said reward, what you actually meant was job with somepony I hate.” Pinkie gasped at the h word but said nothing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, pretty much. But you get to keep Laughter, you’ll be a world hero and there will be plenty of other perks. If you don’t get killed. But considering you would die anyways if you don’t participate, well, think of it as taking fate into your own hooves.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, considering the statistical unlikelihood of five, or four right now, ‘chosen ones’ gathering in the same spot you also just happened to randomly choose, Trixie’s guessing we are non-unique bearers. What possible thoughts could have been running through your head when you decided to recruit Trixie?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose that’s a fair question. As I told you before, I think you deserved it. Also, I personally rather like you which is a big head start since I’m probably going to be the limiting factor in all this friendship building by far.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So,” Dash began, “I sort of get what’s going on—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“More details will come shortly,” Index added in quickly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“—but I’m confused about one thing in particular. Who are you exactly that you know all this?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, the reason I’m here as Index Code is to make friend making easier, but two of you can spot polymorph and Pinkie is friends with every pony… Lyra, do you know Dash well enough to know if telling her would be a problem?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Go ahead. Short of Princess Celestia herself or the Wonderbolts, I don’t think she cares.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Cares about what?” Dash asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Rank,” Index answered, dispelling her polymorph. “I’ll keep up the act in town to make things easier for me and Ponyville. Also because we’re still missing a bearer for Generosity. But when were alone I guess it doesn’t matter. My real name is Twilight Sparkle, archmage of Equestria.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie nudged Dash and whispered, “Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, but it does explain her connection to the Wonderbolts.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, by the way. A word of warning for anypony else here with secrets. Lyra has honesty so she can tell when you’re lying, or omitting truths, although she can’t tell exactly what is false or omitted.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Also, when we pick up a bearer for Generosity, they’ll have incoming telepathy so your thoughts will be an open book when the necklace is on. Between us, the telepathy is two way, so I guess you can take some comfort in that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A brief run down on other powers. Laughter, which Trixie holds gives a charisma boost. Basically it can tell her just what to say to get a certain effect.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dash has Loyalty. It can track the location of other bearers and elements if the two are not in the same place. Actually Dash, if you would, try checking if you can find a response for the bearer of Generosity.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash concentrated for a moment and shook her head.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, well that’s fine. I’m sure you think that’s not an awesome power but you also get the ability to teleport directly to the location of an element or bearer. Distance is not a factor.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s actually sounds pretty awesome.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I agree. Teleportation is pretty useful. A minor ability everypony has is the ability to summon their element. We could leave our elements lying around Equestria to allow you fast travel all over without having to worry about losing them.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“For obvious reasons I haven’t tested, but how durable are the elements?” Lyra asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can’t say for sure, but Celestia says that they have taken quite a beating before so I’d be willing to guess nigh indestructible. Probably requiring some grand quest or something to destroy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right, fires in which they were forged and all that,” Lyra finished.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The elements are also near useless for non-bearers so we don’t need to worry about anypony else getting hold of them.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Didn’t you say you lent yours out?” Trixie asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I did. The elements can be lent but only the basic abilities are usable. These include a magical boost, the ability to summon it, and the stabilization of chaotic magic such as may be found in the Everfree. A lent element may be unlent and recalled at any time. There could be other abilities but those are the known ones.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m currently lending mine out to stabilize the magic in the Everfree so a huge number of traps and wards can be laid down where Luna will reappear just before sunrise on the Summer Sun Celebration at the end of her banishment.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really, Twilight?” Lyra asked incredulously. “Luna? You’ve been together <span style=" font-style:italic;">two days</span>. Two Days! Eldritch horrors. Teeth. Om nom nom. Remember?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash leaned closer to Pinkie and whispered, “Am I missing something?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie only shrugged in reply.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine. Where Nightmare Moon will reappear. Happy?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not really.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You know, Nightmare Moon’s not even a name.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Om! Nom! Nom!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie demands to know what Lyra meant by ‘being together’.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“One of L—Nightmare Moon’s abilities is to enter other pony’s dreams. I might mention that this is probably the only ability she could use over the past thousand years. In one sense it’s good since we don’t have to deal with a completely insane goddess.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Unfortunately, on the other hoof we have a goddess that is sane and has had a thousand years to set up all manner or counter measures. Possible even ones that take into account being hit with the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And at this point I am now remembering that I have two elements left to explain.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Subtle,” Lyra said to the change in topic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ahem. Pinkie’s element is Kindness and she can feel the emotional states of others. Please don’t abuse that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I Pinkie Promise that I will only use it for good.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, that’s not helping. Anyways, last is Magic which is my own element. It has the ability to summon all of the other elements and prevent a reverse summon. Presumably this is a failsafe in case one or more of the bearers goes insane — see Nightmare Moon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The other plus is kind of implied by the name. I get a massive boost in magical power while wearing it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“One other thing to watch out for, which I’ve already mentioned to Trixie, is that the longer you stay away from your elements the worse you feel about that. I’ve been away from mine for…five days now and I’m starting to get a little pent up about it but nothing too serious.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now on to the fine details. Lyra and Trixie, feel free to chat amongst yourselves. I’m not going to cover anything new for a while.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, in conclusion, our first and foremost priority is finding a bearer for Generosity. Think of generous ponies you know outside of Ponyville. I’ll finish testing the residents of Ponyville and hopefully we’ll get a hit.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“All I have left to test are the foals. I feel kind of bad about it but stakes are high and I would have gladly hopped on board as a filly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ll meet again tomorrow and see if we have any developments. Also games or something. In the interim, Pinkie seems to be unable to hold back her party desires any longer so we’ll meet up in after sunset for a party at the Sugarcube Corner.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Adjourned.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With the meeting over, Twilight repolymorphed and teleported the group back to the outskirts of Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie disappeared immediately in a burst of streamers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie and Lyra walked off together. To Index at least, it seemed the pair had hit it off pretty well. Pinkie would have no troubles given she’s Pinkie, but Index was still worried about Dash and whoever ended up being Generosity getting along with Trixie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Speaking of Dash, she remained with Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, Dash. What’s up?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… I’m not really good at this whole, asking for help thing…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dash, you get more awesomeness out of whatever you do after asking for help than if you preserve your current awesomeness by not asking for help. Usually. On average your awesomeness should go up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I guess that’s one way to look at it. Even if it’s the most eggheaded way ever.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pft. Egghead is such a weak term. I’m the archmage. A position that has gone unfilled for centuries. I think I’m well beyond egghead. Think of it as sage advice. Everyone loves sage advice.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, anyways. When I was a filly I managed to perform a sonic rainboom. I’ve never told anypony this before, but it was a total fluke. I haven’t been able to do it since. I was hoping you could tell me why. You are the archmage, after all. I could use some sage wisdom.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pegasus biology and magic is not a subject I’m particularly familiar with, but I have some experience as one. I might be able to help. What have you tried doing to increase your speed?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I train nearly everyday, exercising my wings trying to go faster and improve my agility. Along the lines of standard Pegasus training if you’re familiar with it, but cranked up to eleven.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm… I might have an idea. Have you tried going as slow as you possibly can?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why would I do that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“From what I’ve heard about you in town, you’re at a level where you can’t really get anything more out of your muscles and your technique is solid enough that you’ll only get marginal returns on improving there. What you need to work on is your magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Like Trixie and I, you were probably born with a lot of magical strength. That would explain how you managed a sonic rainboom as a filly accidentally. Pegasus education only covers weather magic since the magic you use when flying is incredibly instinctual the way unicorn telekinesis is. It was a nightmare for me to learn the very basics since I was emulating pegasus magic and lacked that instinct. It would be no surprise if you neglected improving that aspect of flight completely.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What you need to do is turn that instinct into control. Figure out how to push yourself with it stronger and more efficiently. That’s the best I’ve got without a lot more time to think and experiment.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s more than I could ask for already. Thank you so much.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No problem. It’s what friends are supposed to do. If helping you is what it takes for you put up with me, and more importantly Trixie, I’ll give you all the help you need.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s not the right way to think, you know. You don’t buy friendship.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A cynic would say you do in one way or another. But I understand your point.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, don’t worry about yourself. As far as I’m concerned, we’re already friends. I’ll…work on Trixie. But anyways, I still don’t see why I’d want to try going super slow.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, again this is just guesswork. Educated guesswork, but guesswork nonetheless. The times I’ve flown myself I’ve found it incredibly difficult to fly slowly because it required finer control of flight magic than I could muster. It should help you become aware of how you’re using your magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“However, what I did was no true pegasus magic. It could be entirely different for all I know.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, what you’re saying makes sense. I’ll try it out and see how it goes. See you at the party tonight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. Have fun.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index didn’t know whether to be happy or frustrated with Generosity. It had stubbornly refused almost every pony in Ponyville, fortunately now including the foals. It certainly wasn’t living up to its name.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index was walking back from Sweet Apple Acres. More specifically from the Cutie Mark Crusaders clubhouse. She had saved those fillies for last partially because of the stories she had heard, but also because if one of the crusaders suddenly became special it might break their friendship. Although, Index did stop to wonder if they realized the likelihood of all three having the same cutie mark was extremely low.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of course, somehow Index managed to miss Sweetie Belle. Apparently she went home to do some chores she forgot.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Which is totally generous,” Index said, staring at Generosity floating invisibly nearby and drawing a few looks from ponies on the street.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still a little bit away, Index could hear Rarity shout, “And stay out!” as a blue auraed Sweetie Belle was tossed out the front door.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, I suppose that’s one way to find somepony.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index nudged the depressed looking filly with Generosity and it awakened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I suppose I can’t say I’m really surprised. Generosity waited until the very</span> <span style=" font-style:italic;">last pony to come out of its shell and picked a filly.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What am I going to do with a filly? There’s a reason I never played with them when I was one.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, hay. Sweetie will be able to read minds. Goodbye, secret identity when needed most. Then again, I suppose she’ll probably enjoy the undercover shtick. But still, what do I do with her?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Hmm… I guess Celestia said the bonds were the important part. It doesn’t have to be strictly speaking friendship. Am I willing to take an apprentice? I know I thought of it before, but it was just a thought. Dash and Pinkie will be fine, Lyra will probably be okay, but Trixie might be a problem. I guess we could share Sweetie as a student…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sigh… I guess I’ll go with the student idea for now. Not like I have any better ideas.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index walked up to Sweetie Belle after stowing Generosity in her saddlebags. Sweetie had been facing the door, sitting on her rump and trying not to cry.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, Sweetie,” Index said causing Sweetie to jump, turn around and fall down. Index couldn’t help but laugh at the pile of limbs Sweetie made before standing her upright with magic. “So, what happened?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Rarity kicked me out.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, I can see that. Why did she do that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was cleaning up. And I thought I’d surprise her. By cleaning her workshop. But then she got mad.” Sweetie sniffed before adding, “I never do anything useful.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, if that’s all, I have something very important that only you can do.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t know…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And while we’re at it, I have something that I was going to give to Rarity, but I think you should instead. She’ll be so overwhelmed with joy, she’ll completely forget about something petty like cleaning up her mess.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“R—Really?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep,” Index said, fetching Rarity’s ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala from her saddlebags and giving it to Sweetie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie recognized the fancy golden ticket almost immediately. Her eyes widened in surprise and excitement.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s a Gala ticket! Rarity has always wanted one of those!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep, and this one is all hers.” Index opened the Carousel Boutique’s door for Sweetie and continued, “Go on and give it to her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie exclaimed her thanks and ran inside to much shouting that was abruptly cut off and replaced with excited apologies and thanks and then what Index suspected was the sound of Rarity’s over-dramatic fake fainting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Stepping inside the Carousel Boutique for the first time, Index entered a very clean looking room. Parts of it — other than the mirrors — where actually shining. Looking around, the place almost looked like a real estate showcase room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">And Rarity doesn’t appreciate this? I can understand the whole don’t mess with my workspace thing but if Sweetie did the whole house, that should count for something.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index pondered on that a moment more before remembering that Rarity was a drama queen and probably would have realized how mean she had been within the hour anyways. Following the only path out of the room, Index walked up the stairs to join the sisters.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index had walked into the room while Sweetie was busy awakening her sister from one of her usual dramatic faints. When Rarity returned to herself Index had already taken a seat and was watching the sisters’s antics with an amused expression.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Darling! I absolutely can’t thank you enough for this.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’ve been through this before, Rarity. No need to repeat.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, I suppose we have. But still, thank you so much. I know! Would you let me make your gala dress for you? I already have some wonderful ideas for you! You’ll look just marvelous!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sorry but I have official regalia that I’m stuck with.” Seeing Rarity’s smile start to fade, Index requested, “But I wonder if you could make it a bit more interesting for me? Maybe make it a bit easier to move in as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, of course! I would love to! Bring me your…regalia… Regalia?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, I’m actually in disguise right now. My original primary reason for being so is kind of broken by this point but Ponyville <span style=" font-style:italic;">really</span> doesn’t need the attention I’d bring it, and I especially don’t need the interference, so my masquerade continues.” At this point, Twilight dispelled her polymorph before moving on. “My real name is Twilight Sparkle, but I bet you already knew that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity’s and Sweetie’s responses were both over enthused but distinctly different. Rarity spouted several attempts at sentences before fainting away again. Sweetie Belle dealt with the reveal much better but was going a bit out of control proclaiming Twilight’s coolness.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sweetie,” said Twilight gently and surprisingly enough Sweetie calmed down and listened. “If you would wake her, we have more to talk about.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie set about her much practiced art and Rarity was revived once more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, I’m so sorry about that. It’s just. You. Here. Oh, where are my manners! Would you like some tea? Or some snacks? Anything at all?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Tea would be nice. We have a lot to talk about.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That doesn’t sound good…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not, but neither you nor Sweetie not in any legal trouble or immediate danger. It can wait on tea.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, what’s it like being a secret agent?” Sweetie asked after Rarity had left the room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m not a secret agent. The Equestrian secret agents work for me. I just happen to also have many skill sets that overlap with a secret agent. My job is often dangerous and usually tedious but I chose to do it for Celestia so I can’t really complain.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But that doesn’t mean there aren’t any fun parts. There was this one time when I was fighting a doomsday cult. Their leader managed to get his hooves on the alicorn amulet which is a very powerful and very dangerous magical artifact which is why I had the case myself. I let them capture me and take me back to their secret base. Just between you and me they weren’t that smart.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After Sweetie finished giggling, Twilight continued, “So they put me in this ridiculously overcomplicated death trap complete with sharks and slowly retracting platforms. The funny thing is, it almost worked. When I saw the sharks I got caught up in such a fit of laughter that I actually fell into the water. I can’t imagine what the cultists where thinking when that happened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So anyways, the rest of the story is just me kicking tail. Nopony there was really up to tangle with me so it wasn’t that interesting. I guess I’m not that good at storytelling…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you kidding? That sounds amazing! Could you take me on one of your adventures? Apple Bloom and Scootaloo too?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s this about adventures, Sweetie Belle?” Rarity asked, returning with tea and a few snacks.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Index, err, Twilight was telling me about some cultists she defeated.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please don’t give her any outrageous ideas, Archmage Twilight. The Cutie Mark Crusaders are already a walking disaster without any help.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“From what I hear of Ponyville, they’re just the icing on the cake.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, well, I suppose that may be true…” Rarity sighed, seemingly resigning herself to the hijinks of both the Cutie Mark Crusaders and whatever force of chaos that resided in Ponyville, drawing in disaster after disaster. “If I may ask, what is it that you wished to speak of with us?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight launched off on what was quickly becoming the standard course for Evil Goddess 101, explaining both the problem and the viable solution using the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity managed to restrain herself from fainting as she listened with increasing worry. Sweetie Belle looked excited but also guilty for being excited.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After reaching the end of the scenario, Twilight then moved on to detailing how the elements picked bearers and what was needed of them. Rarity seemed to catch on quickly but stayed her tongue. Sweetie Belle seemed like she was eager to be tested for an element but likewise stayed quiet.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And so the last bearer we need is for Generosity which has proved to be the pickiest of the elements. It actually choose the last pony in Ponyville.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity sighed and chose her next words carefully. “I suppose you at least tried to avoid this situation. It does not mean I approve though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie asked, “What situation?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight levitated the last element out of her saddlebags and placed it on the table in front of Sweetie. It’s light purple gem remained in a typical, unassuming cut to match Sweetie’s blank flank.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“This is Generosity, Sweetie, and until the day you die, there is nothing that can be done to separate it from you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie burst into hyper exhilaration mode and started repeating ‘oh my gosh’ and occasionally ‘adventure’ in a faster speed than Twilight thought possible.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“While she gets that out of her system, I think we need to talk,” Twilight said to Rarity. “I understand your hesitance to let Sweetie in on this venture, but my hoof is forced on this one.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know. I am trying very hard not to… I don’t even know. Sweetie’s my little sister. I do not want her in any danger. But at the same time, she will be in danger if she is not in danger. I just… I don’t know.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If it helps I can explain the plan in a bit more detail. For a few days now, and several to come, Celestia has been placing spell upon spell upon spell where Nightmare Moon is to reappear.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If the plan succeeds, none of us there will be in any danger. However, if the plan fails, and Nightmare Moon will be forced to retreat anyways, the only difference between the danger we face and the danger anypony else faces is that we will face it a little sooner.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“However, given that Nightmare Moon’s ire will be placed directly on us, if we mess up we will be hanging out in areas that are secure enough to prevent her from appearing. So, ironically, we should actually be safer than everypony else. Family and close friends will, of course, be holed up in similar areas as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That does help. Quite a bit actually. It still makes me feel bad, but I can not deny what you said makes sense.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">By this point Sweetie had finally calmed down enough to rejoin the conversation and sat down again next to Rarity.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sorry for going out of control there. I know it was not appropriate, for several reasons, but I’m just so excited to get to go on an adventure.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Eyebrow raised, Twilight asked, “Are you always this mature?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course. I am Rarity’s little sister after all.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity smiled and then added, “At least when she is not with the other crusaders. They reveal her inner troublemaker.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Rarityyyyy. That’s not fair.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“See? She is still just a filly inside.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie pouted but didn’t dignify Rarity’s teasing with any further response.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So…here’s the awkward part where I ask for Sweetie for a month.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I get to have adventures for a whole month!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I wouldn’t go that far, but that’s the general idea.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Can Scootaloo and Apple Bloom come too?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sorry Sweetie, but that would be a bad idea. I know it won’t be as much fun and you won’t have anypony else your age there, but…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With Twilight trailing off, Rarity sighed, having resigned herself to what must be done. “Sweetie, the point of spending time with Twilight and the rest of the element bearers is for you all to become friends. If you are too busy enjoying yourself with Apple Bloom and Scootaloo, the whole adventure could end in failure.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I guess that makes sense…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And you would not want your first adventure to end in a humiliating defeat would  you?” Rarity added on.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No way!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight and Rarity locked eyes while Sweetie was distracted and Twilight gave a small nod of appreciation.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, Sweetie, Pinkie’s throwing a party pretty soon for all of the bearers if you want to come.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh my gosh! I haven’t been to a Pinkie Party in so long! Rarity, can I go? Please!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sweetie, you are under Archmage Twilight’s care until this is all over. You can come home whenever you wish, but I am not the one you need permission from for a while. Just Pinkie Promise me that you will stay safe.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I promise I won’t do anything dangerous. Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You better mean that too. If Archmage Twilight had not been there to save you, you could have died in that stampede. You are taking far too many risks lately.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie hung her head. She didn’t have anything to say to that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now come give me a hug.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When Rarity finally released Sweetie from her embrace, she said, “Take good care of my little sister.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Naturally. Now come on Sweetie, we’ll be late if we dally much longer.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie hopped off the couch and went to Twilight’s side as she finished her Polymorph again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Forgetting something?” Twilight glanced at the table where Generosity waited.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh yeah!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie ran to pick up Generosity and moved to put it on but Index’s magic prevented her from doing so. Sweetie and Rarity said their goodbyes for the moment and Index and Sweetie left.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once outside and a bit further away, Index said, “You can put Generosity on now if you want.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie did so happily and asked, “Why did you not want me to back with Rarity?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Because you get telepathy.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Whoa! That’s so cool!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I have some experience controlling my thoughts but Rarity has none. Probably. I doubt you or she would have wanted to hear her unfiltered thoughts. You should be able to learn how to only hear thoughts you want to hear, but at the moment Generosity will give you everything by default.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How do I do that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I don’t really know. Celestia says that when she had Generosity it was sort of like tuning out background noise in a crowed room except the background noise completely dropped out. I think it will mostly be a practice makes perfect kind of thing.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">You should also be able to send thoughts to bearers and hear their thoughts regardless of distance if you focus on them.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie and Index walked in more silence than before for a few minutes until eventually Index started hearing Sweetie’s thoughts.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Hello?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I can hear you Sweetie.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This is so cool! So who else is a bearer?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Lyra, Pinkie, Dash and Trixie.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Trixie…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Now Sweetie Belle, be nice with her. She’s a part of the team and rather talented as well. She’s a bit odd and she hates me but I at least like. Lyra does too. Come to think of it, Apple Bloom and Scootaloo seemed to like her too, although Apple Bloom switched once her sister lost. Why don’t you like her?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Silence reigned in Index’s thoughts while Sweetie Belle kept her mental tongue.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sweetie?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">It’s because… Because she said she was better than you.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sigh… Sweetie, that’s very flattering, but it’s not really a good reason to dislike somepony. But if that’s your reasoning, you might want to not wear Generosity around Trixie until you learn how to filter thoughts.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, I said Trixie hates me. I basically remind her of everything that’s wrong in her life. It might be a bit much for you. Trixie might be able to keep her past out of her thoughts, but she wouldn’t appreciate you learning about it by eavesdropping. Still, it’s your choice what you do with Generosity.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie spent some more time thinking. Occasionally Index could hear a brief buzz of thoughts come from Sweetie. Probably messages mistakenly sent when Sweetie thought a bit harder much about Index.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As they approached the Sugarcube Corner, Index stopped Sweetie Belle just outside Generosity’s passive mind reading distance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We’re here, Sweetie. You need to make a decision soon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie spent a couple more minutes in thought and then looked up at Index. <span style=" font-style:italic;">I think I’ll keep my element on.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. Now let’s go have some fun.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Late next morning, the bearers of the element assembled far outside of town after their Pinkie party. Their first order of business was to see if they could use the elements at all yet.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had summoned her own element and sent a message that she would return it soon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight invoked all of the necessary spellwork as the bearer of Magic to unleash the elements’s rainbow colored blast and unsurprisingly to her, they produced nothing more then a brief magical gestalt that quickly fell apart.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She even had the group try again targeting the Everfree Forest just in case the spell needed a real target, but they met with no more success.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After both failures, the group relocated to the same place they had met the day before. Today, Twilight, Lyra and Trixie had worked together to produce a more complete hall with the same theatrical theme Twilight had gone with earlier. Anypony accidentally stumbling upon the site would be very confused, finding a grand, formal, ominous building with very nice chairs in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I call to order the second Council of Elements,” Twilight proclaimed. “So, there’s no sugarcoating it. We failed miserably out there. But that’s okay. It was expected. We just need to spend more time with each other. So, does anypony have any ideas? Other than Pinkie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We should go on a quest!” Sweetie shouted.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A quest?” Trixie asked. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You know. A quest. We go on a grand journey to a far off place to accomplish some big goal and at the end we have all become inseparable.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That could work,” began Trixie, “if we had a quest of some kind to go on. It’s not like the world just has epic quests sitting about for adventuring parties to pick up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie’s gaze quickly shot to Twilight. “Please tell me you don’t have epic adventures just lying around.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, not epic adventures of our own. At least, not other than the one we’re technically on. But I do have a lot of work as the archmage that I had to redistribute to teams of other ponies.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So you want us to do your work for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not exactly. It was already delegated away so it’s not really my work anymore.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rolling her eyes, Trixie said, “Fine… What do you have?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm… There was an oversized hydra that needed slaying.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No thanks,” Lyra said. “Combat missions are more for you, Trixie and Dash. I’d like to avoid them if we could.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. How about an investigation? The EIS asked me to find a missing artifact that they think has wound up in wrong hooves.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Boring,” said Dash.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay. Then…Oh! There were these thirteen miniature ponies we heard about heading to their old kingdom’s capital at Smokey Mountain seeking to reclaim their lost wealth from the dragon that currently resides in it. A team was being prepared to be dispatched to make sure they don’t do anything too stupid, and, if the worse comes to the worst, deal with an angry, rampaging dragon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That sounds awesome!” Dash said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah!” Sweetie agreed. “It has everything: a journey, a dragon, a horde, potentially an epic battle.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It we must,” Lyra conceded, “but no deliberately provoking the dragon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie added, “I’ve never thrown a party for a dragon before! That would be so much fun!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose I don’t have much choice. The Great and Powerful Trixie will lend you her skills.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. I guess I’ll notify Celestia we’ll be taking care of this one then. It’s still early so go home and pack light. We’ll leave from town square in an hour.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Dear Celestia,</span></p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px; font-style:italic;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">So, the rest of the elements and I are going on a quest. We’ll deal with the miniature ponies that are heading to Smokey Mountain to poke a sleeping adult dragon and steal his horde.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Yeah…I don’t really know what they’re thinking. But everypony is for this as a friendship building activity except maybe Trixie but she just really dislikes me. The dragon’s not ancient so I should be able to take care of things if anything goes wrong.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Please notify anypony that needs to know so we don’t get an extra team sent after us.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Also, I gave you Magic back with this but if things go terribly wrong — or terribly right according to Rainbow Dash — I’ll be summoning it back.</span></p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia folded up Twilight’s letter and stashed it in her own portable pocket with the rest of Twilight’s letters she had received over the years.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What in Equestria is that mare doing?” Celestia said, face-hoof complete.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Twilight said, after running around frantically for a few days, the amount of work Substitute Archmage Daisy had to do was diminished greatly. She still had enough to want a teleport spell, but not so much that her hooves ached at the end of the day.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">By now, her work consisted of three things: paperwork, meetings, tiara holding.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The latter was relaxing despite taking place in the Everfree Forest. Daisy spent most of that time reading through interesting old scrolls and books from the Canterlot Archives that she now had access to.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her favorite branch of magic had always been evocation but that had little practical use in ordinary business so she hadn’t had much chance to study in for the past two decades.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">While Princess Celestia focused on her spells, Daisy would cast some of her own she hadn’t been able to without the boost from the element of magic. Occasionally Princess Celestia would even comment on her work and offer suggestions and Daisy enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">What Daisy did not enjoy was the paperwork. She had to learn a couple spells to increase her reading speed just to finish reading everything presented to her. Understanding what she had read was an entirely different matter.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">One time she had almost signed off on a thinly guised power grab by the nobility to restore some of the military rights they had lost in the past century. Just before the document was to be sent off to be processed, Daisy had ripped it out of a clerk’s hoof, reread it and burned it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That had been quite a scare. Daisy would have gone back to reread everything she had already signed if it wouldn’t have killed her for the effort. Still, she resolved to be much more careful in the future.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her last task was attending an endless slew of meetings. At first those involved had been reluctant to run anything by Daisy. Her opinion was worth little and everypony figured she was just asking Princess Celestia what to do in secret.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">However, after the first day of that, Princess Celestia showed up herself and made it abundantly clear that Daisy was acting in full confidence as the substitute archmage and would be treated as such.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That had changed a lot of minds very quickly. Unfortunately for Daisy, their opinion of her went from ‘waste of time’ to ‘exploitable’.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy couldn’t believe the kind of requests that were made of her. At first they were obvious and offensive, like ridiculous tax hikes on commoners and benefits for the nobility.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After zero success with the straightforward approach, subtler requests were thrown into the mix between obtuse ones.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her favorite insulting law so far was requiring a manners test to be made a high ranking government official that only the Canterlot elite would have any hope of passing. She almost agreed to it because it was posed as sensitivity training.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy had quickly grown skilled at pattern matching from the constant need to think faster. A week into her work started to notice common threads between the legislation presented to her and the requests asked of her. It seemed a lot like somepony was directing these plots behind the scenes but she had yet to meet any pony smart enough to pull that off.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia had no idea, or wasn’t telling, who it could be. Twilight hadn’t warned her of anypony in particular either. Still, something was definitely up and Daisy wanted to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If only there weren’t so much other work to do.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy started to wonder if Princess Celestia and Twilight were really ponies. Princess Celestia was an alicorn so she could sort of understand that. But Twilight was just a regular unicorn that somehow had time to be the archmage, raise a dragon, go on the occasional field mission, and research.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Whatever the secret was, Daisy wanted in.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Deep in the Everfree forest, the bearers of The Elements of Harmony lay concealed within many wards, observing thirteen miniature ponies. Six or so had been tied to a spit and were being rotated by a troll.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Somehow the ponies had managed to get the three trolls present to argue about how to cook them for the past two hours. Sunrise was coming soon and if the trolls were outside when it came, they would be turned to stone.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, I know we have spells up on them to prevent them from actually being eaten or cooked,” Dash began, “but explain to me again why they’re even here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Indeed. Trixie would like to know what could have possessed them to travel through the Everfree Forest instead of taking the train.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I have no idea,” Twilight answered. “I had heard they were, and I quote, ‘classical examples of PCs needing a GMPC to save them every day’, unquote, but this is pretty sad.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Shh!” Pinkie said with accompanying hoof gesture. “I can’t hear the funny trolls if you keep talking.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah,” Sweetie agreed. “These guys are great. I want to hear everything they have to say.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Would you pass the popcorn, Trixie?” Lyra asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A few bowls of popcorn later and dawn was poking up over the tops of the trees. The trolls were still covered in shadows but it wouldn’t be long now until the first pricks of sunlight caught them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, look,” Trixie said. “The ponies have a unicorn with them.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon had felt awkward with Lyra hanging out with Index everyday. Now the two had run off together to who knows where. Sure there were other ponies with them, and it was business of some kind, but that’s how these kinds of things always start.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When Bon Bon realized just what kind of things she had meant she went into a panic, completely denying she was jealous. Still, even after a day she couldn’t managed to forget.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon was losing Lyra. That much she knew. Yet every time she tried to think of how to get Lyra back she returned to those thoughts of love she never realized she had before.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She tried telling herself that Lyra wasn’t lost. Lyra had only made some new friends and was getting to know them better.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It didn’t work.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Clearly, something needed to be done.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Three days without Sweetie Bell and Rarity was beginning to break apart with worry. She had even pressured Lotus Blossom to move her and Fluttershy’s spa date up but that only gave Rarity complete reign to worry without the distraction of her work or the festival overseer’s work which Twilight had asked Rarity to handle while she was gone.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Fluttershy was Rarity’s best friend and absolutely wonderful but she was terrible at comforting ponies. And yet, Rarity needed somepony to talk to and Fluttershy was an excellent listener and secret keeper.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After they had left the spa, Rarity and Fluttershy stopped at the Sugarcube Corner for lunch where Rarity spilled out all of her worries completely truthfully.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh my goodness. That is troubling,” Fluttershy said in her usual barely audible tone.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can’t stop worrying about my darling little sister, Fluttershy. I don’t know what to do. I couldn’t very well say no to the archmage, not with so much on the line and especially not with my Sweetie Belle so eager to help.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It will be okay, Rarity. I’m sure that anypony that can be an archmage can protect Sweetie Belle.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I know. I’m almost glad I don’t know where they are right now or I’d go running off after them.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, Rarity… I don’t—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s okay, Fluttershy. I just needed somepony to talk my heart out to.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright. If you ever need anything, my animal friends and I will be behind you all the way.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The miniature ponies had nearly made it through the Everfree Forest. Their latest distraction was giant spiders that captured and bound them. Their unicorn companion saved them from the terrible fate of becoming spider food after a somewhat epic fight forced the spiders to retreat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rainbow Dash would have loved watching that fight. The entire group would have as well if they hadn’t found something even better.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ha ha. Yes, it’s very funny,” Dash complained in a monotone.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nopony heard Dash over their laughter. Twilight and Pinkie were hit especially hard.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Get me down!” Dash screamed from where she was caught in the giant spider web like a common house fly.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia awoke and immediately realized she was in her dream world. Almost as quickly, she disabled all of the traps and other assorted horrors that guarded her dreams and created an exit from their subspace to the dream proper.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Luna!” Celestia called out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">No response came. Celestia tried to force the world to take her to the only edge of her dream deep in the heart of the disabled traps, but she was having difficulty maintaining her calm.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Galloping straight into the nightmare zone, Celestia called for her sister over and over but earning no response for her effort.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Plunging into a dead heat, she reached the entry point to her world just as Luna slipped out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t go! Please!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia knew that the damage done to Luna’s mind couldn’t have been fixed by a mere thousand year time out. Even if this was a plot of some kind, she desperately wanted to see her sister.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If Luna only had blame and hate to give, Celestia would have been okay with that. Anything would be fine if only she could see her again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia spent the rest of the night watching the entrance to her world for the slightest hint of blue emerging from it.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight and Luna sat on top of Twilight’s tower basking in the beauty of the twilight. Luna was drowning herself in Apple Family Cider that had slightly fermented. It seemed that a pony could get drunk in dreams which made Twilight wonder how.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At least, she would have been pondering that if she didn’t have a drunk and depressed alicorn to take care of.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I tried. I really did. But. But I fled at the last second,” Luna said in between draws on her bottle. “She even disabled all the traps for me. And I just left. She’s probably still there waiting. And I— I can’t— I don’t want to go back.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight moved from her chair and grabbed Luna in a tight hug.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s okay, Luna. She’s waited a thousand years for you already. She can and will wait as long as you need. She’s your big sister and she loves you. Nothing will change that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A sniff came, then two, and finally Luna started sobbing quietly into Twilight’s coat.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You know, I’m a little sister too. I once broke my brother Shining’s formal armor his marefriend Cadance helped make for him. I was young practicing a spell that required a bit too much magic for me at the time. I was so worried about how mad he’d be that I hid from him for a whole week.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“When he finally caught me he didn’t even care about the armor. He just went on and on about how worried he was and how much he missed me. I know it’s not the same, but Celestia won’t care. She just wants to see you again. I know that makes you feel worse. Just remember, you have ponies that care.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was a certain problem with being asked to investigate everypony and everything for treason: there are a lot of ponies in the world. EIS had to get moving at full speed for the first time since its founding.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Soulful Dusk, head of the EIS, had an eternal headache trying to get everypony organized. The promise of triple time had managed to sufficiently motivate the rank and file all the way up to the department heads, but Dusk quickly realized that motivation is not the same as organization.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">So far, they had uncovered a surprising number of various plots and schemes that had gone unnoticed within Equestria. However, each was, as Honorable Zeal, head of the field agents, put it to her, ‘not terribly important, interesting, or relevant’.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">While most of the uncovered problems deserved EIS attention, so far they had absolutely nothing suggesting a large revolt in the works orchestrated by an unknown potential usurper.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Tensions were a little high with the dragons, but that was no different from usual. The griffins were still unusually docile but it hadn’t been long since Archmage Twilight went on a rampage and even the prideful griffins knew when to be careful.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In other words, everything seemed peaceful. If the order to investigate hadn’t come from both Princess Celestia and Archmage Twilight, Soulful Dusk would have called this a success and wrapped up the investigation.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And she would have banished Espionage on some far flung mission so she could escape from his constant nagging. Espionage was technically her subordinate, but the archmage had a tendency to make requests directly to him and the archmage’s orders came first.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you have anything today for Princess Celestia to look at?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Just some minor stuff if she wants,” Dusk said while holding up a folder for Espionage. “Can you explain to me why I still can’t close the book on this? Or at least give us more information about this would be usurper.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No. The princess and the archmage want that information spread as little as possible. We know exactly who and where the usurper is and how it communicates, just not to whom. EIS’s job has nothing to do with finding the usurper, just figuring out who we need to guard against.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If we find nothing in the next few weeks then that’s great. But we will keep searching even if there is nothing to find.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ugh…” Dusk let her head fall onto her desk and mumbled into it. “You keep telling us to find evidence of untraceable meetings in suspicious actions and out-of-character behavior. You might be able to do that. Zeal might be able to do that. But most of our agents are not good enough to weigh evidence that subtle without getting too many false positives to sift through.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then hire more ponies. We have always been understaffed anyways. Zeal and I are almost finished with internal investigations so we’ll have time to spare to do checks on new recruits for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine. I’ll start pulling from the royal guard and central army. You’ll need to get Princess Celestia to give the go ahead or else Prince Shining Armor and General Otto are going to eat me alive if I take their troops.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll have the paperwork on your desk within the hour.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey, why do you…” Dusk raised her head to find Espionage had somehow left already. “I wish he would stop pretending to be Batmare.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sighing, Soulful Dusk went back to her work. Espionage would be back within the hour as he said. She could ask a personal question later.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee had gotten quite fed up with hiding in her home, filling out form after form. Instead, she took her work out to town for an extremely extended lunch break. It wasn’t much of a change, but it was something.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She wished Index was available to help her. The one time Cheerilee asked her to help, Index demonstrated a knack for polishing off tedious work in short amounts of time. It was too bad much of what needed doing was private or she suspected Index could have done it all in a couple days in exchange for a bottle of Apple cider.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Across the aisle and down a ways, Cheerilee could see Rarity enter the restaurant with Bon Bon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s an odd combination.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For a moment, Rarity and Bon Bon looked to be getting their own seats. However, once Rarity caught a glimpse of Cheerilee she brought Bon Bon over to her table and asked to sit down.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What brings the two of you here together?” Cheerilee asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, Index asked me to take care of her duties for her while she goes off on some other pressing matter. Mayor Mare wanted to know if you would be willing to help direct the foal activities for the Summer Sun Celebration.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee eyed her stack of papers warily.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity caught on quickly and said, “I am technically government employed right now. I could help you through your work if that would allow you the time you need.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That would be a big help. If we can finish the next couple weeks of work in a dead heat I’d be happy to direct foal activities.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Excellent. I just knew we could count on you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, aside from that, what unusual circumstances have pulled you two together?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity shifted awkwardly and Bon Bon looked away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, this isn’t a date is it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No.” Bon Bon and Rarity said together. The pair looked at each other and Rarity gave Bon Bon the go ahead.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was asking where Lyra was. Rather intensely. I figured Rarity would know since Index left her in charge.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After years of dealing with students and their budding romantic interests, Cheerilee was quite good at spotting the particular kind of embarrassment Bon Bon was showing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you don’t mind the clarification, it’s Lyra right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon quickly grew flustered and blushed which showed up quite obviously on her light yellow coat. Then she nodded weakly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see. Nothing like the spark of jealousy to make a pony realize their feelings.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon let her head drop onto the table and covered it with her hooves. From this position she mumbled, “Please don’t tell Lyra. I don’t think she sees me that way.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Darling, you simply can not give up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon raised her head. “No. I won’t. But I need time to make it work. I honestly don’t know if she’s interested in…well anypony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What makes you say that?” asked Cheerilee.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, whenever a topic like that has come up she either tunes it out or looks kind of sad. Not like tragic past sad, but something else.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, you do not need to worry about losing Lyra to Index at least.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What do you mean, Rarity?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The reason why Lyra has been hanging out with Index so much is… Well, the details are classified — oh, I’ve always wanted to say that — so I can not tell you much. But they are working together on a job that Index was given after she arrived here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s nothing dangerous is it?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If it were, I would have fought tooth and hoof to keep my own Sweetie Belle out of it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What was that?” Cheerilee interjected. “Generally foals are not hired for government work.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity sighed. “Yes, I know. This was an unavoidable situation though. And both Index and Trixie are decent mages as they so clearly demonstrated earlier. Rainbow Dash is there too so she can make a quick escape with Sweetie Belle if anything goes wrong. At least, that is what I tell myself.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That still doesn’t sound right,” Cheerilee said. “I think I need to have a talk with Index.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sorry your little sister got dragging into whatever they’re doing, but it does make me feel better.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s good. But if you would, please do not bother them much until after the celebration. They will not be done until then and they really do not need distractions.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cheerilee reluctantly agreed. Bon Bon was quicker to accept with worries about losing Lyra pushed to the corners of her mind.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now then,” began Rarity, “what shall we have for lunch?”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What are they even doing in the White Tail Woods!” Dash exclaimed. “We saw them walk over the train tracks between here and the Everfree that lead to Ponyville. There is literally a train station right at the roots of the Smokey Mountain.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Relax, Dash. If things get too bad The Great and Powerful Trixie will step in and defeat the Lupus beast. For now just enjoy the show.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra said, “You do realize that starbeasts are incredibly resistant to magic, right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course! There’s more than one was to skin a hare.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie looked up at Trixie with sad eyes. “You don’t skin rabbits, do you, Trixie?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… Trixie may have been looking for a pun from Laughter and might have chosen a suggestion that was less well thought out than it should have been.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Whew. That’s good. By the way, do you think you could teach me that fireworks spell?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Aren’t you Twilight’s student?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, but… Twilight teaches from theory to practical and just has me working on levitation to build up my strength and creativity. She says it will be good for me in the long run, but I’d like to know some interesting spells now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hmm… Alright. But Trixie has been demonstrated to be a bad teacher in the past. No complaints if you get a little burnt on your own magic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie jumped around in joy and agreed to Trixie’s condition. Trixie lead Sweetie off a ways from the group to get some safety clearance.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The remaining three’s attention had been drawn away from the comedy in front of them to watch this little exchange.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Aw. That’s so cute,” Pinkie said. “I didn’t think Trixie had that in her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Neither did I.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course she did,” Lyra said. “Trixie’s really nice on the inside and cares about her friends. You just have to get past the wall of ice first. Much like Twilight, except she defaults to nice until you annoy her so it’s harder to tell she’s not treating you as a friend.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra went back to watching the thirteen miniature ponies running around the forest absent their unicorn companion that had slipped off at some point. Twilight was flying around keeping them safe. Pinkie said Twilight was between annoyed and amused which was probably the best they could ask for.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s a good thing she’s warmed up to us,” Dash said. “We could have been in a lot of trouble with Nightmare Moon otherwise.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Is that what you think? Pinkie, could we get an emotion report?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Roger!” exclaimed Pinkie with a sloppy salute. “Twilight’s emotions are usually pretty controlled so it’s hard to get a read on her. Once and a while she is clearly having fun, but just as often I get a weird feeling I haven’t felt before from her. That’s about everything I’ve got, Commander Lyra.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What about when she talks about Celestia?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She gets a warm happy feeling like I have all the time!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well there you go, Dash. More or less what I thought. She’s trying, that much is obvious. But she’s putting up with us.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Maybe less so with Sweetie. Sweetie’s doing pretty well learning what Twilight has to teach and I think she’s genuinely enjoying teaching. I think she also feels guilty about Trixie for some reason but that’s probably not helping.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That stuff aside, we’re definitely being held at arm’s length. It doesn’t mean we could never be her friends, just that we may not have enough time to become so.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash stared thoughtfully at Twilight flying around in the distance. A moment later she said, “I think I’m going to go join her,” and flew away.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With Dash gone, Lyra could ask Pinkie the question she really wanted to know the answer to. “Pinkie, what about when Twilight talks about Nightmare Moon?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Warm fuzzies all the way down, clear as day.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you, Pinkie.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, I suppose I already saw that coming. There’s no helping it either. Ponies like Twilight make friends for life. I suppose I’m the one that’s going to have to make sure that friendship is turned the right direction.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Heh. Still funny that she acts like that and is worried that somepony else will cause a problem when the final battle comes.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So,” Scootaloo began, seemingly uninterested in finishing her sentence. “What should we do today?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t know,” Apple Bloom replied. “It’s just not the same without Sweetie Belle.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We could go see what Dinky is doing.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration neared the final week, Ponyville became truly busy. The town was positively bursting at the seams with visiting ponies who had resorted to renting out rooms in ordinary homes.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The restaurants could not keep up with demand which brought the festival stands into town early. With that part of the festival already up and running, nopony else wanted to be left out resulting in the festival getting into full swing extremely early.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mayor Mare had been quick to put her hoof down and shut down everything that didn’t serve food. She wouldn’t be able to contain the excitement for long, but she could at least put it off for a few more days so the fun didn’t burn out early.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Across the room from her desk buried in papers where Mayor Mare sat fighting a battle with said papers, an unexpected knock came. Mayor Mare’s assistant, Berry Nectar, entered the room.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What is it?” The mayor asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have a visitor. One Daisy Wishes. She apologizes for the unscheduled meeting but she insists it is rather urgent.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Did she say what it’s about?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, but she did ask that I show you this.” Berry Nectar held out the archmage’s badge of office. A badge every local head of government was as familiar with as Princess Celestia’s own crown. However, much of the rank and file had no knowledge of it as the archmage rarely made requests except at the top of the chain of command.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you sure she said her name was Daisy Wishes? No never mind. Just show her in.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Berry Nectar retreated out the door and left the mayor alone. Within a minute, Daisy stepped into the office and sat down.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, if you’re showing that badge off it’s not a disguise. I guess the question then is why do you have it and what are you doing here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Daisy Wishes, acting archmage which Twilight Sparkle is off on an extended mission. That is not secret, just not important enough to officially announce. As for what brings me here, there are some contingencies we need to cover regarding the Summer Sun Celebration.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Contingencies? You’re not thinking of canceling the celebration are you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not exactly. It’s possible that the main character may be missing, late, or a substitute might appear.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mayor Mare’s thoughts shut down. A substitute? For Princess Celestia? That didn’t make any sense. Perhaps she misheard.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Could you clarify that please?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sure. This is all top secret, and I’ve only been informed of what little I know recently, but I’ll do my best.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The big outline is Celestia might be overthrown or otherwise occupied during the usual sunrising event and since it’s kind of a big deal we need you to make sure whatever happens goes over smoothly. Especially if another alicorn named Nightmare Moon, or maybe Luna, appears and lays claim to the throne. We don’t want anypony dying over that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If Mayor Mare had been drinking coffee, it would have been sprayed all over her unfinished work and maybe on Daisy as well. Daisy silently rewarded herself with one point she had lost to Twilight a few weeks ago.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After she had suitably enjoyed the mayor’s expression, Daisy went on to explain the details concerning Nightmare Moon along with the ways Princess Celestia had come up with for Mayor Mare to help ease the transition of power if it became necessary.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What in Equestria were you thinking,” Twilight scolded thirteen soot covered miniature ponies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I might as you the same question,” the miniature pony leader said. “This is no business of yours.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you kidding me! You tried to steal from a sleeping dragon! Now it’s on a rampage and we have to deal with it before it finds you or a city.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">An explosion went off in the far distance where Dash and Trixie fought with the dragon. Somehow it was loud enough even on the outskirts of the battle to briefly deafen everypony there.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ow. Sweetie, please tell Trixie to keep it down.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t think that would help, Twilight,” Pinkie Pie said, a faint hint of awe in her voice. She also said it far more subdued than normal which Twilight completely missed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why not?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because—” Lyra said as a second thundering crash swept by them, this one sounding suspiciously like a dragon being slammed into a mountain side. “Because that was Dash.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wha—?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A third explosion with the accompanying sound of an avalanche came again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, now <span style=" font-style:italic;">that</span> was Trixie,” Lyra said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Did they kill him?” Sweetie asked. “I mean, he was mean and scary and probably a bit evil, but he was still a person.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Probably not,” Lyra answered, “I’d guess that he was only an adult dragon, but even adult dragons are harder to kill than that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey! I never got an answer, what was that first explosion?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It was—” Lyra began before being interrupted by both Pinkie and Sweetie Belle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A sonic rainboom!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh.” Twilight stared towards where Trixie was searching for Dash from the sky. “Sweetie, would you check if Dash is alright.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She says she’s fine. A bit battered up and covered in soot, but alright.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I guess it must have been a short burst or Dash would be halfway across Equestria by now. Still, obviously enough to punch an adult dragon into next Tuesday. It’s a good thing she had protective spells on to blunt the impact.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Oh, I bet the ruined my spell circle at the base of the mountain. Note to Self: Fix Smokey Mountain circle later.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Suddenly remembering she was in the middle of something, Twilight returned to scolding the miniature ponies they had rescued from a fiery death.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Please, Aunt Cadance,” Spike begged on his knees.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Next to Spike, Star Charmer was similarly showing her support.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, you two. We will go to Ponyville for the festival when Shining goes with the rest of the royal guard in…four days now. You’ll just have to wait.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But I want to see mom!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, Spike. If you don’t stop asking I’ll having Shining put a silencing spell on you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike gulped. A silencing spell from Uncle Armor meant being trapped in a humiliating shield spell that rolled around. He walked away slowly in defeat with Star Charmer, shoulders drooping.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Once both were out of Cadance’s earshot, Star Charmer asked, “So, today or tomorrow?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I was really hungry today, so I won’t have any gems until dinner.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Tomorrow then. Make sure mom doesn’t see you pocket the gem.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ve got this. Don’t worry. Train tickets are cheap so we’ll only need a small one. She’ll never notice.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t forget some extra bits for things to do while we’re there. I hear all the excitement has started early this year.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index and company reappeared on the outskirts of Ponyville with a cart full of dragon treasure. Gems of every kind lay interspersed piles of gold and silver coins of various sized. An occasional magical item, crown or other knickknack could be seen if one looked hard enough.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Pinkie was sitting on top of it pretending to be a dragon herself with Sweetie playing along. They were putting on a classic knight and dragon fight routine although it seemed Pinkie had no intentions of losing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie was still ogling the pile thinking about what she could do with her sudden influx of income. Oddly enough, from words that occasionally leaked out of her, it seemed that she was interested in soaking most of it into improving her wagon. Especially purchasing the extremely expensive components needed for building an orderly portable pocket to make the wagon’s inside bigger than the outside.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra seemed uninterested. It wasn’t that surprising considering she chose her current lifestyle in Ponyville rather than being forced into it by birth or necessity.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index figured she’d give her share to Spike. It would be just the right size for a horde of his own to sleep on; it was something for which he had pestered her for years.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey,” Lyra said, “are you sure you teleported us to the right place?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course I did. Ponyville’s right over…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the distance was not Ponyville so far as anypony could tell. Instead the town in front of them boasted of thousands of tents varying in size, shape and color. Rising above them various attractions could be seen: theaters hastily constructed but solidly done, a ferris wheel and other tall rides, temporary structures and decorations, sound systems. There was even a sizable guard roaming around keeping order.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“They set up without me!” Pinkie yelled and disappeared.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Lyra, how long were we gone?” Index asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not long enough for the celebration to start. It must be running early.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh no!” Trixie gasped. “I need to start my show!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie disappeared in a teleport leaving behind a surprised Lyra and Dash.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After recovering, Dash asked, “Why does she even need to bother? She brought back a chunk of dragon horde.” Looking at Sweetie’s sad face, Dash changed her question. “What do you know about this?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I… I can’t say. I overhead her thoughts before.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t hold out on me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Dash, I know I’m not one to talk seeing as I pried into Trixie’s life myself, but you should drop it. At least until after Nightmare Moon returns. We don’t have time for a bonding exercise that long.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ugh. Fine. So who’s up for some festival fun? There’s candy apples in there with my name on them.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Me!” shouted Sweetie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why not,” Lyra agreed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll join you in a little bit. With all these ponies in town, we’ll need to store this horde somewhere more secure.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index disappeared with the horde in another teleport. The three remaining ponies began their short walk into town.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Enough was enough. It was time to start making demands.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had expanded her dream world considerably over the past two weeks, and yet she spent well over 99% of the time in her tower in either the lowest basement, which contained her water park, or on the third floor in her library.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">To be fair, the water park probably consisted of a mere 5% or less, but it was a clear outlier when compared to anywhere else.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Despite being in the basement, the water park’s ceiling could be modified with the flip of a switch to offer an unimpaired view of the sky. Floating around lazily staring at the sky was one of Twilight’s new favorite activities.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Floating next to her now was Luna. Luna had spent each night in Twilight’s dreams since she first appeared, with the occasional failure induced nightmare mixed in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sometimes they played games, often they discussed magic and other sciences, and occasionally they would just hang out and talk about whatever was on their minds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna had been very surprised to learn Twilight was mothering a dragon. Twilight had been just as surprised to learn Luna had spent more of her life in banishment than free.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">More and more, Twilight realized that she liked Luna. Maybe even more than Celestia. Along with that came the worry that she wasn’t seeing the real Luna or that after the elements blasted her a different version would be left behind.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight almost wanted to call the whole mission off, but that could prove disastrous and the team would probably get a single chance to try. Better to risk losing a friend than risk losing Equestria and possibly that friend as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Despite how well they got along, there were a few topics they avoided naturally and Twilight needed to bring them up before the solstice and Luna’s return.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Working up the courage, Twilight asked, “Luna, could you explain the… Well, the whole eternal night thing?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna rolled over so that her face was underwater and silence reigned. It was the awkward kind of silence that made a pony want to say anything to fill it but neither mare was going to divert the topic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">An endless slew of bubbled floated to the surface, suggesting that Luna was practicing her answer where Twilight wouldn’t be able to hear.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Eventually, the bubbles stopped and Luna rolled around again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You have lived twenty some busy years. You’ve had a lot of distractions during that time. I’m sure you’ve also done several things that, in retrospect, seem kind of dumb. But still, you’ve managed to do an awful lot in that time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Now imagine having a fifty times longer just to think about mistakes you’ve made. Things you wish you could have done differently. I’m still <span style=" font-style:italic;">very</span> upset with my sister, but I’m grown up enough to admit that the eternal night idea was not so brilliant.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I spent years trying to justify it, generating possible ways to make it work. But there were too many problems. As much as I delight in cold places, the world would freeze, and my sister and I would be the only things left on it. Even the ancient dragons must awaken and eat every other millennium.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alicorns don’t need to eat?” asked Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There are a great many things alicorns do not need to do, but we do them anyways. We do need to sleep though. I have never understood why. It is especially odd considering ponies like you almost entirely cut the act out of their lives.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m sure that puzzle will eat away at me later, but for now, what is it you actually want to do with Celestia? After…well, what happened earlier, I’m guessing you don’t want to kill her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I think my sister could use a time out of her own. At least to start with,” Luna added with a scowl. “She’s certainly not getting off with anything less than that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And if we could, I would very much like to get off this topic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sighing, Twilight acquiesced.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">At least I learned some more about alicorns. It seems probable that they are literally indestructible. However that works. It would square with what Celestia said about being incapable of killing Luna, even with a perfect ambush.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Also the fact that both sisters are still around. It would have made a lot of sense if one of them had died in their previous decisive battle.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight and Luna returned to simply floating along with the currents in the pool. Eventually they started chatting again. Twilight about how Equestria is, and Luna about how Equestria was.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna loved hearing the details of the griffin retreat. Twilight had to admit, the whole thing was pretty funny, even if it was a bit embarrassing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the other direction, Luna had thousands upon thousands of interesting stories she had gathered over years of dream walking in addition to her own extensive history. More than that, Luna was a practiced storyteller and could easily enthrall Twilight with even the most mundane of stories.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then, in the midst of a changeling tragedy, Twilight’s dream world shook without actually shaking. There was a sense of the universe wobbling back and forth incessantly without any of the effects a pony would associate with a universe scale earthquake.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose that would be Pinkie Pie waking me up,” Twilight said said as the dream world started to collapse.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You’d better go see wh—”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The midmorning train from Canterlot pulled into Ponyville station. A huge crowd disembarked and easily overwhelmed the small station that was used to ten or so ponies on it at any time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Among this group was the very unusual sight of a young dragon accompanied by a filly pegasus.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As odd as they were, nopony paid Spike or Star Charmer any attention as they pushed their way out of the swarm and into the streets of Ponyville.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, should we find Aunt Twilight first?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike stood still, seemingly thoughtful for a moment. “Nah. Let’s have some fun first before it gets really crowded here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Star Charmer nodded and they delved into the festival that was already in high gear.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With their saddlebags heavily lined by part of Spike’s previous dinner, the two lived like a king and queen. They didn’t have time to try everything available, but they did do everything that looked interesting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There were hundreds of food stands set up, but aside from a snack or two, Spike and Star Charmer mostly ignored them. They never had any trouble getting the castle kitchens to cook anything for them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Some of the rides were interesting, but Star Charmer’s interest in them was limited considering she could fly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">What really drew their attention was the wide variety of games and street performers. The Great and Powerful Trixie had proved especially enjoyable and seemed to have an almost magical silver tongue.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But even more interesting, was something Star Charmer and Spike just happened to stumble upon. Something being organized by three fillies…</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Earlier, at the edges of the Everfree Forest far from Ponyville, the elements of harmony congregated.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight could feel the incredible energies the gestalt was channeling through the artifacts. It was unstable, but the raw power could be directed. Controlled. It took the right, delicate nudge to send it flying in its harmonious wrath to clean up a small portion of the Everfree’s chaos.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The change probably wouldn’t be permanent while the rest of the Everfree remained as it always has, but it was enough proof of concept.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sure, aiming was incredibly difficult, and it took forever to work, but the elements were functioning. Everypony had managed enough friendliness to appease the demanding jewelry.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But after the initial elation had worn off, Twilight knew it wouldn’t be enough. It was too slow. They wouldn’t have much time to aim, let alone power up, before Luna would escape her bonds. The only consolation is Luna would be fatigued after such a show of brute force.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This might not even be the required full power it stabilize Luna. Delaying the problem another thousand years was viable as far as solutions go, but Twilight would rather have Luna in Equestria.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That wasn’t the worst part though. Twilight had felt the elements fight her every step of the way. They may have begrudgingly accepted that the group consisted of mutual friends, but they were clearly of the opinion that the relationships had a long way to go.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Remembering the spell circle the elements used to supplement their own inscrutable magic in the gestalt, it seemed that the strength of the connections between friends was indicated in the level of detail in the leylines manifested between ponies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was a bit disheartening to see her own were by far the weakest, even if she had expected it. Although, somehow she had managed to create a solid bond with Sweetie Belle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was spared the others being aware of this particular detail, and she was grateful for that. The other five bearers were far to busy floating, glowing, and otherwise being subjected to channeling raw cosmic power to have noticed anything interesting during the spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, good work team,” Twilight congratulated everypony. “We managed to put up with each other and even like one another enough to get these elements to work. Way to go Dash and Trixie. Also, good work me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was a general round of self-congratulations and pats on the back. It was too soon to do any real celebrating, even for Pinkie Pie, but they had taken the first, biggest, and most important step.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight, can we have the rest of the day off?” Sweetie asked. “I wanted to go catch up with Apple Bloom and Scootaloo.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I mirror that sentiment. Bon Bon’s been getting really lonely or something. I promised to spend the greater part of today with her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie needs to put on her performance today as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight shrugged. “I don’t see why not. We could use a day of rest and time with other friends. Personally, I haven’t been able to do any research in weeks and it’s turning me into…a lunatic.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t need Laughter to know that was a terrible pun,” Dash said. “Just how bad was it, Trixie?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Laughter doesn’t have a scale high enough.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">While the other five shared in a good laugh at Twilight’s expense, she teleported away. They continued laughing for a bit longer before they realized their taxi had just left and none of them actually knew where they were.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Well, except for Dash. Sort of.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um…Twilight’s off that way” — Dash pointed southeast — “and I think she’s in Ponyville. I’ll see if I can bring her back to carry you all.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash similarly disappeared into a rainbow colored Loyalty teleport.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Don’t worry,” Pinkie said. “Trixie and Lyra can get us home even if Twilight gets distracted by the super fun party in Ponyville without me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">An awkward moment passed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then another.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then a few minutes.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then Dash returned with a pint of ale, a novelty hat and a swab of cotton candy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, so… I’ve got a party to get back to. I’m sure you can make it back on your own, right? Twilight’s prob’ly not comin back. Got wrapped up in somethin else.” <span style=" font-style:italic;">*hic* </span>“See ya.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Dash disappeared back into the rainbow light she had appeared in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can’t believe it!” Pinkie shouted. “They really are partying without me! What’s so funny Sweetie?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie finished laughing and said, “Twilight’s not hiding her thoughts from me. I wouldn’t want to spoil it. Oh, she escaped! Poor Dash… Well, she said ‘I’ll come pick you up if Trixie and Lyra are too lazy to do it themselves.’ I think she meant you three included, not just me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Bah! The Great Trixie doesn’t need her help. I’ll find my own way back.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Trixie disappeared in a flash of smoke.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’d appreciate a ride myself,” Lyra said. “If you would, Sweetie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Moments after Sweetie placed their request, Index reappeared without warning as she always did when teleporting. Immediately, the group felt the wrench of transdimensional movement and reappeared in a sleepy corner of Ponyville which was becoming a rare thing recently.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Where’s Dash?” Pinkie asked. Index gave her best guess and Pinkie disappeared as fast as usual.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Next Lyra said her goodbyes for the day and left Index alone with Sweetie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thanks for the lift, Twi—Index. See you later.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Somehow Sweetie managed to meet up with her fellow crusaders almost immediately and they ran off to cause unknown havoc in town.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Index heard the voice of Cheerilee calling for more of her blood, although absent Sweetie Drops. She figured the two had spit up to cover more ground or Lyra had met up with her roommate.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Hearing Cheerilee grow closer, Index slipped into the shadows and left.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That,” said Spike.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Star Charmer continued, “Was.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then together, “Amazing!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And good thing too,” said Apple Bloom, “because we’re in a whole mess of trouble for it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The Cutie Mark Crusaders plus Spike and Star Charmer were sitting outside Mayor Mare’s office waiting to be scolded and likely punished. Their latest escapade had drawn the ire of the mayor directly on them despite her being swamped in work already.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At first, Star Charmer and Spike had merely been watching the Cutie Mark Crusaders, but when the pair was noticed, they were invited to participate as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I still don’t know how you managed to set that tent on fire,” Spike said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo looked away, a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie Belle patted her on the back. “Don’t worry Scootaloo. It happens. I bet the mayor doesn’t even care about it. Not compared to…well, you know.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Nervous glances were shared all around.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It sure was lucky that Index showed up when she did to help out. Otherwise we’d be in a much bigger pile of trouble.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah… Lucky,” Sweetie Belle said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sweetie Belle’s right. We did kind of run off while she was busy. She’ll probably be even madder than the Mayor when she finds us. At least she didn’t see you two.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike shrugged. “Not like it matters. She’ll hear about us being there. We can only hope we slip away from this before she shows up here.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That, and hope Twilight doesn’t hear about this,” Star Charmer added.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At the mention of Twilight, Sweetie’s attention was immediately aroused. Catching the tail end of Spike’s thoughts while he was shivering confirmed that they indeed meant Twilight Sparkle the archmage.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie decided to press for details, asking, “How do you two know Twilight?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Star Charmer and Spike looked surprised and discussed quietly amongst themselves for a moment. Sweetie, listening in on their thoughts, determined they were concerned about breaking Twilight’s cover. They also dropped an interesting fact that stunned Sweetie.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Who’s Twilight?” Apple Bloom asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo added, “Is it somepony you met while you were away with Index?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie completely ignored those questions and shouted the one thing on her mind. “Your her foal! But… How?” Sweetie had too many competing questions to get anything more articulate out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The conspirators turned back to Sweetie and Star Charmer asked, “If you already know then why did you ask? And furthermore, how do <span style=" font-style:italic;">you</span> know Twilight?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Completely forgetting her fellow crusaders, Sweetie answered, “I didn’t. I can read minds. And I’m her student.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That confused Spike and Star Charmer even more than Sweetie was flabbergasted by the idea of a dragon as a foal. And from somepony as young as Twilight even.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The group stood in silence, each pondering their own mysteries for a few seconds. There was some background noise and confused questions from Apple Bloom and Scootaloo, but they went unnoticed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie then remembered her friends were with her and broke her stupor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… Apple Bloom. Scootaloo. I think I owe you two an explanation and an apology. But first, why don’t we all make reintroduce ourselves more fully.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A brief uncertain look went around before everypony nodded. Apple Bloom went first.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Apple Bloom, of the main branch of the Apple family. We owe Sweet Apple Acres here in Ponyville. Granny Smith is technically still head of the family, but Big Macintosh deals with all the business for her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… I’m Scootaloo. I don’t really have anything more than that…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m Sweetie Belle. I bear the element of generosity” — Sweetie gestured to her necklace — “and am the student of Archmage Twilight Sparkle.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo and Apple Bloom were about to start asking a million questions but Sweetie Belle told them to wait.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“My full name is Spykoran, son of the same Archmage Twilight Sparkle. She hatched my egg long ago and adopted me. Most ponies call me Spike for short.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am Princess Star Chaser, daughter of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, or Cadance if you don’t want to make her mad, and Prince Shining Armor. Dad’s captain of the royal guard and happens to be Aunt Twilight’s older brother. I prefer it when ponies do not use my title.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And then the flood of questions started from everypony. For Sweetie who could hear every question, said or thought, it was impossible to hear any single question from among the raging throng.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie had practiced filtering thoughts and ignoring some with the other bearers, but it still required effort and she was unprepared for just how many thoughts jumped at her. There would be no better time to put her practice to the test.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mostly successful, Sweetie managed to answer most of the questions directed at her, and only answered a couple that were not actually asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star chaser naturally had less issues answering questions sent their way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When everypony had their fill of answers, Sweetie extracted promises from Apple Bloom and Scootaloo to keep everything said a secret until at least after the festival and ideally forever without good reason.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">While excitement from her fellow crusaders died down, Sweetie had collected that both were interested in making the same offer.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“On behalf of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, the majority of whom are currently a bit too out there to ask, I would like to extend an invitation to join our group,” Sweetie Belle said to Star Chaser. “The same goes for you Spike, even though you’re only technically a blank flank like us. It comes with a cool cape as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star Chaser both agreed. Neither knew any other ponies in Canterlot that would be interested or meet the qualifications, but Ponyville wasn’t too far to visit occasionally.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, now that that’s done, I have bad news,” Sweetie revealed. “About seven minutes ago, Twilight found out you two are in Ponyville. About three minutes ago, she found out you were here. About two minutes ago she teleported into Mayor Mare’s office. And about…now—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">On cue, Twilight opened the door of the mayoral office from the inside. She looked like her rage had boiled over and reduced to a stern simmer. She pointed at Apple Bloom and Scootaloo and then inside towards the mayor.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sheepishly, they went inside and Twilight closed the door behind them.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Next, the three remaining felt a few bodiless yanks that accompanied teleports and found them selves in Twilight’s tower in Canterlot.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When Twilight wasn’t explicitly trying to mask her thoughts, Sweetie found it easy to follow along. But there were occasionally times like this where they came too fast and were too frequently amended and too often symbolic instead of verbal for Sweetie to understand.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She could tell that her new friends were getting increasingly worried as Twilight stared and decided what to do. The rational part of her brain knew that most of their thoughts were just their imagination run wild, but the other part of her brain was building on those fantasies and making her panic too.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight started to say something but then closed her mouth and returned to thinking. Sweetie thought she caught the scent of a question Twilight was going to ask but it was quickly obliterated by other thoughts that were probably answers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then the sound of grinding teeth came briefly from Twilight, followed by a sigh.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Spike, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had apologized. Sweetie could see the train of logic solidifying in Twilight’s mind but she was still as stunned as the other two.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I haven’t been able to find time to visit and I’m sure you’ve been lonely. I really should have taken time to say hi, even if it was only for a minute or two. For that, I apologize.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Now Twilight turned her attention to both Spike and Star Charmer.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t know whose idea it was to come to Ponyville, <span style=" font-style:italic;">unescorted</span>, where I was <span style=" font-style:italic;">in disguise</span>, but I’d be willing to guess that even if you didn’t <span style=" font-style:italic;">both</span> come up with it, the other immediately agreed.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike and Star Chaser gulped at Twilight’s correct accusation.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“For that, I think I will let Cadance have her way with you. She will be able to drive home the lesson you need to learn far better than I can. Between then and now, I expect you to think about all the ways that could have gone horribly wrong, resulting in injury, abduction, or worse. Especially with Luna returning in five days.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight paused, and now addressed all three of them. “As for the…incident…all of you caused today. I do not know how you did it. I do <span style=" font-style:italic;">not</span> want to know how you did it. I especially do not want to know how the umbrellas got involved.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The mayor is thinking about prohibiting the Cutie Mark Crusaders from assembling in public or private” — Sweetie gasped — “but will not forbid you to see each other at all since only as a group do you cause such chaos. I suppose she will amend that to any three of you since Spike and Star Chaser have both just joined.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie didn’t have time to ponder Twilight’s amazing hearing as she continued. “She has other penalties in mind for Scootaloo and Apple Bloom, but I convinced her to let me dispose of you three as I see fit.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The thing is, I can’t think of what to do with you. Tell me honestly — I can bring Lyra in here if I think you’re lying — do you regret what you’ve wrought?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A little bit now that you point it out,” Sweetie said while the other two were still thinking about how to respond, “but not primarily. It was a lot of fun and it’s hard to sort out those feelings from wanting to not be punished.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well? What about you two?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“P—Pretty much the s—s—same,” Star Chaser stammered.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Getting Twilight’s glare all to himself, Spike barely managed a nod of agreement.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight turned away and went to sit down. She sighed again, but this one was much slower and longer than before.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Have you eaten lunch yet Sweetie?” Sweetie shook her head. Twilight looked to the other foals and said, “Take her down and get her something to eat. On the off chance you haven’t eaten, get some lunch yourself. When you’re done come back up here. No detours.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The three crusaders marched out of the room and started the long climb down from the tower to the kitchens.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Back in Ponyville, Trixie heard a full account of the crusader’s fiasco while looking on the results Twilight hadn’t already cleaned up.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wow. Trixie is impressed. This is even better than the music room.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Three of the five crusaders sat in the Canterlot dinning hall. Sweetie Belle had a full lunch, possibly the best she ever had despite Rarity’s insistence on fine cuisine, while Star Charmer and Spike only had small snacks.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, do you know what she’s going to do to us?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not really, Star Charmer. I have no idea what language she’s thinking in, but it’s not modern Equestrian. Although, the names Velvet and Night Light come up occasionally in whatever conversation she’s in. Do they mean anything to you two?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“They’re our grandparents,” Spike answered.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Star Charmer moaned, “Oh, we really messed up…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Finishing their lunch in silent contemplation, the trio got up and left the hall.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A little over halfway back to the tower, Sweetie asked, “I—Is there are different way we can go?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Aunt Twilight said no detours. She’ll know.” Star Charmer looked back at Sweetie. “Are…are you crying?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie nodded. “There’s somepony nearby whose thoughts I would rather not hear.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike looked sympathetic for a moment and then confused. “Can’t you just take the necklace off?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie’s eyes widened, realizing that was an option. She brought her magic to Generosity to lift it but then stopped and pursed her lips.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What’s wrong? Do you need help?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Spike stepped forward to pull Generosity off. If there was anything that made Spike glad he was a dragon, it was opposable thumbs. But as he reached out for it, Sweetie jumped back.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“S—Sorry. I just…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">One of the weaknesses of Generosity was every thought had equal intensity, making distance impossible to tell. Thus, Sweetie Belle was surprised to look up and find Princess Celestia behind Spike and Star Charmer with a unicorn she hadn’t met before.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Not that Sweetie had met Princess Celestia before either, but it was difficult to mistake her for anypony else.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hello, Spike, Star Chaser,” Princess Celestia said, causing the pair to jump. “What brings you two here today?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Neither wanted to answer but the silence grew too awkward. Star Chaser then explained, “We’re heading up to Aunt Twilight’s room. She’s really mad at us.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight’s back? What happened?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We sort of snuck off to Ponyville to go see her and…did something…really bad.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, I hope she is not too hard on you. I assume your friend here is an accomplice. Might I ask…” Princess Celestia noticed Sweetie was still crying, though not as hard. Recovering, she modified and finished her sentence, “What is wrong?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie was struck dumb. She had no answer for Princess Celestia that wouldn’t sound rude or worse. It wasn’t long before Princess Celestia recognized Generosity.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh…” Princess Celestia said, her smile disappearing quickly. She dusted off her memories of Buffalo promised herself to spend the rest of the day thinking solely with it. “I am terribly sorry you had to hear all that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um, hear what?” Daisy asked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll explain later. Anyways, I would appreciate it if you would tell Twilight I want to talk to her later. I shall pay her a visit in her tower in a couple hours.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We can do that,” Spike said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Thank you.” Princess Celestia turned back to Sweetie. “I’ll leave you to everypony else’s thoughts.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia and Daisy left, much to Sweetie’s relief despite the princess switching to some other language midway through their one way conversation.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As soon as the princess was out of range, Sweetie started walking again and said, “Let’s go. Please don’t ask.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Star Charmer and Spike looked at each other as Sweetie walked by and then rushed to catch up to her.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the main foyer of Twilight’s tower, Celestia and Twilight sat together enjoying conversation. Celestia had originally come to discuss her work in the old castle and hear about Twilight’s progress, but with that out of the way they spent time catching up with each other.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">They shared little details of their day to day lives and eventually the topic turned to today.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I ran into the bearer of Generosity in the castle today. I never caught her name.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She’s Sweetie Belle. Normally she’s pretty much everything you could reasonably ask for in a filly or a student and a little bit more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But when she gets together with two specific other fillies, who are also otherwise very nice, chaos always results. I’ve already informed the guard that they are never allowed into the gardens together under any circumstances.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see. Was she upset when you came back?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, I gave them a bit of a guilt trip before I sent them down to lunch. I guess it worked better on Sweetie than I thought it would.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No… That was me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh? What did you— Oh no!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If I knew she was in the castle I would have been more careful with my thoughts. Unfortunately she got a full dose of me at my lowest.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What happened? Please, please tell me it wasn’t worse than finding out about Trixie!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie? As in Beatrix Lulamoon?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Horsefeathers! Can you just pretend I never said anything?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Of course not. What happened to Trixie? The last I know is she was expelled. As sad as that is, I don’t think Sweetie Belle would take it that hard.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ugh… This is why I didn’t bother mentioning the names of the bearers. Well, I guess you’ll find out one way or another now, but you didn’t hear this from me and you will say nothing of it to Trixie and do nothing about it. I won’t tell you if you can’t agree to that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose that’s fine…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, you remember that Trixie lived in the dorms and had a full scholarship. Turns out she faked a lot of her paperwork. Pretty well too since nopony noticed. I have to admit, even I might not have been able to do that at her age.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, when she was expelled, she went back to living on the streets. Eventually roaming around as a showpony.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight stopped and let Celestia connect the dots.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You mean…she was on the streets before then. As an eight year old.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A lot earlier as well I’m afraid.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And we threw her back into the streets…” Celestia was losing her ability to form words. “Why?” was all she managed to ask.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight shrugged. “I never pestered her for details. She’s very sensitive about it. As a filly, I would guess she didn’t know she could seek help at first but then either didn’t want anypony to know and or didn’t want to admit she had been abandoned.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose I should make that clear. She is not an orphan. It’s just nopony knows where her parents are and she doesn’t have anything to track them with.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I can only guess that the whole traveling showpony thing is a way to let her parents come to her. As she’s grown, she’s probably tried other approaches unsuccessfully, but again, I didn’t pester her for details.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Personally, I think they’re dead or far, far away and uninterested since the didn’t turn up in Esp’s report. Not that I’d ever say that to Trixie.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">To Twilight, Celestia looked like she was tearing herself apart inside.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Hey! No dwelling on this. It’s done. Trixie doesn’t want your pity anymore than she wants mine. She’s begrudgingly happy I gave her Laughter, but only because it wasn’t really my decision if it accepted her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight knew what she said wouldn’t keep Celestia from blaming herself even though she had no hoof in the story, but she thought it would at least help.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The silence was momentarily broken by Celestia. “Maybe I should just let Luna have Equestria. She couldn’t be any worse.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What? Did she really just say that? I know she didn’t really mean it, but wow.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">This is going to require a nonstandard approach. But what?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight took a moment to think of how to make Celestia less than miserable. Then she took another. She took perhaps too many more moments.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But then an idea came to her that would be effective with such a long pause.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia looked up confused.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If that’s what you really want, I’m sure I can make the transfer of power easy for her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you serious?” Celestia asked, a fire in her voice bringing it up to the Traditional Royal Canterlot level. “<span style=" font-weight:600;">You would let me gamble Equestria, no, the entire world in a small funk!</span>”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight smirked and Celestia immediately realized what just happened. The anger left her just as quickly as it had come but the gloom didn’t return as strongly.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Feeling better?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A bit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Good. I did sort of mean what I said though. If we fail, I have another backup plan in place.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia looked in incredulous and prompted Twilight to elaborate.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“First, I’ll mention that I’ll speak with me doing the actions, since that would be preferable, but I’ve left redundant instructions that will let one of a number of undisclosed ponies take over if I die.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, let’s assume Luna banishes you and gets the throne. If she behaves like she does at night then Equestria will be fine. I could probably talk her into releasing you eventually as well.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How much have you been talking with her?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“All night, every night. Except a couple where she failed to get into my dreams. Enough to know that I like her. Like really like her. I really hope she’s not acting and she’s what I get after the elements blast her.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Give me a description.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Smart; well learned; incredibly funny; an excellent speaker, especially so with stories; quick to anger, but usually as quick to forgive; ruled by her ruling passions; no sense of personal space; utterly unable to hide her emotions; loves teasing me way too much; a prankster—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia started laughing cutting Twilight off. “Yeah, that sounds a lot like the original Luna before her grudge took her. I’m glad you like her. Whatever happens, she’ll need a friend other than me when she comes back.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But anyways, you had some plan for an evil Luna you were going to explain.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Right. I’ve been working on a side— no, it’s not a side project. I’ve kept the main focus of my research for the past year completely secret.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Actually, I’ve been picking Luna’s mind for the information I need to finish it, but she doesn’t want to tell me. Probably rightly so. But that’s not terribly important.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The main spell requires <span style=" font-style:italic;">a lot</span> of magical power. More than I, or you, or even Luna, can provide. The spell then requires me to tap all the solidified magic in the world, which is still not enough. I’ll need a kick start from you or Luna to get things going. I think I can use the elements of harmony as an amplifier now that I know about them, but I’ll have to look into that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, tapping the planet for magic. While on field missions across the world, I’ve been slapping down the utility spells required to pull off such a feat. I’ve covered most of it by now.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, I have access to enough power to break you free of anything Luna does to you, throw her back onto the moon for thousands of years, and ruin any chance I have of ever casting the complete spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Honestly, unless my life were at stake, I would not even think about doing that. Luna will call the bluff. But I can use it to bully her into not being too horrible.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“In conclusion, don’t do anything stupid if it looks like we’re losing.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia took a few minutes to absorb everything Twilight had just said. By this point, she had managed to regain her passive, calm smile that made her so hard to read.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m concerned about you channeling that much power and even more so with you casting anything that requires that much power. Do you mind explaining why you haven’t discussed it with me at all? There are few topics Luna can help with that I can not.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">No answer came as Twilight grappled with the idea of spilling everything.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After waiting and realizing that Twilight wasn’t going to respond anytime soon, Celestia said, “Very well. I will leave well enough alone for now and try not to let my imagination run wild.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Someday we need to sit down together for a few weeks and tell each other all of our secrets. I hear your dreams are pretty crazy, but maybe you could visit mine. We’d have all the privacy we need there.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia reddened, and asked, “How much did Luna tell you about that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Not too much. Just that you traumatized her. Although, she did say you made it pretty peaceful when she visited a while ago. I never got a straight answer out of her about why you’re so hostile to visits.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, Luna would often spy on my dreams in the past. From how well you seem to know her, I’m sure you can imagine why.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I learned how to enter the dream world and how to tell if Luna was around. I dragged her into my dream world and…forced her to leave with means I am less than proud of. Until recently, she never tried again.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I really need to finish <span style=" font-style:italic;">Entering the Dream Realm</span>,” Twilight offhoofedly said.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You found a copy of her book? Where?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The archives still had a copy. They stuck it in the restricted restricted section. I keep promising myself to spend more time in there, but I never get around to it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Weird. She took most of her texts…somewhere. I never found where she hid them. I’m surprised she left that particular one behind. I do still have a copy of her first novel though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia was obviously stifling her laughter at the mention of Luna’s first attempt at storytelling.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, you’ve got me interested. Tell me about it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, gosh. Where to begin? It’s simply awful. You wouldn’t believe how bad it is. Like, so bad it came out the other side as a comedic example of everything you can do wrong. I swear, if somepony asked me what color purple was, I’d tell them to go read it. Hold on a second.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia disappeared into her signature teleport, her body dissolving into light. Twilight always wanted to learn how to cast it since it went right through wards and had no apparent range limitations, but Celestia always deflected her request for one reason or another.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With her mind on alicorn secrets from her time pressing Luna for them, Twilight realized that it was probably a racial spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And a clue.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But that could some later. Celestia reappeared from condensing light and pulled a worn, thin book out of her portable pocket.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, so here’s what we’ll do. It’s pretty short so we can read the whole thing. We’ll take turns reading until the reader laughs. Then we hoof it over.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sounds like a challenge.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep. I think my record was just over two-hundred words. I’ll go first.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had her tower permanently warded to prevent sound from leaving it. It was a good thing too, or they would have kept all of Canterlot awake as they read into the night.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna had barely walked into the same room as Twilight before Twilight fell into an uncontrolled fit of laughter.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Confused by Twilight’s outburst, Luna checked herself for any extra features. She was still a regular pony-sized blue coated alicorn. Nothing seemed off.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was possible Twilight modified her so that only she would see anything odd, but Luna didn’t think Twilight would do something silly like that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was nothing particularly interesting in the mostly bookless library either.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I give. What’s so funny?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I—I re—” Twilight could barely manage putting together single syllables. Her laughter was beginning to hurt as she gasped for air. “Re—Read <span style=" font-style:italic;">F—Fur—ri—rious Ve—Veng—gence</span>.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">What!</span>” Luna shouted in the Traditional Royal Canterlot Voice. “<span style=" font-weight:600;">I destroyed every copy of that!</span>”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight only replied with more laughter and occasional wheezes.</p>

<p align="center" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">With the last spell circle now etched, it was time to return.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Three hours until the return of Nightmare Moon and four until the sun is supposed to rise. That thought consumed Mayor Mare.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Somehow she had managed to subtly turn the town’s decorations in a direction that would be equally pleasing to both a sun or moon goddess.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Every mention of Celestia or the sun specifically in town was removed without raising suspicion. She was still amazing she accomplished that.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She even managed to write a speech that would seem welcoming to eternal night in hindsight, but would otherwise seem like a slightly odd sun celebration speech.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For all her success, Mayor Mare was not ready for a regime change. The substitute archmage had made the potential transition seem like it would go smoothly, but Mayor Mare hated that kind of utter optimism.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It simply didn’t work in Ponyville. The mayor found that there was no level of pessimism quite high enough to avoid being surprised by <span style=" font-style:italic;">some</span> disaster in town.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">What she really needed was somepony to talk to, but she had been expressly forbidden from revealing the information to anypony.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She figured Index would know already, but the overseer never seemed to be around. Mayor Mare figured she was probably off performing miscellaneous preparations for the cataclysm. It was likely the reason she was here at all. Probably from EIS too.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The mayor sunk lower into her chair. She had delegated all of the work for the rest of the night so she could sit on stage and just wait.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As the time passed, other ponies of import started to appear. More recently, Prince Shining Armor and Princess Cadance arrived with their family. The prince left right away to go about his guard duties leaving a very worried looking Princess Cadance alone.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright men! Listen up!” Prince Shining Armor shouted. A small host of guards stood in front of him, already listening to his every word. Their commander had laid down more warding spells to prevent eavesdropping than the rest of the guard knew collectively which had already made them worried.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Today’s celebration is going to be an important day in the history of Equestria. Far more so than usual. Whatever happens, you are not to do anything, and I mean <span style=" font-style:italic;">anything</span>, without orders. Everything that happens today has got to look like it was fully expected and natural.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even with the famous discipline of the Royal Guard under the prince’s direct control, murmurs of confusion and questioning hovered in the air.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“If you have questions, now is the time to ask. Yes, Flash Sentry?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What exactly <span style=" font-style:italic;">should</span> we be expecting, sir?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Understand that absolutely nopony is to speak of what I am about to tell you.” The crowd was completely silent which signaled their approval. “This year there will be between zero and two alicorns present.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Best to worst cases are as follows: Princess Celestia and her sister Princess Luna, Princess Celestia, neither, Princess Luna, Nightmare Moon.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Unsurprisingly, the entire crowd looked confused.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see that none of you have any idea who Princess Luna is. I see a few less confused faces so I expect you were raised somewhere where Nightmare Night is popular.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“As I said, Princess Luna is Princess Celestia’s sister. The younger one to be specific. She is the alicorn of the moon. She is also the same pony as Nightmare Moon. The latter is a corrupted version of the former.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“After this is all over, Archmage Twilight might give us the details. I only know a few myself. What is important is that whoever lays claim to the throne gets it. In any case but the second, today is going to make waves internationally. An unstable Equestria is just asking for trouble.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Any other questions? No? Good. Then take up formation. And remember, as far as the public knows, it is all according to plan.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance sat with Spike and Star Charmer on the celebration stage. They had shown up early with Shining Armor. They usually would have spent the time having fun in town but Spike and Star Charmer were still in trouble.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, Cadance almost wanted to go anyways. She had only recently been informed with her husband of what was happening. Of course she knew <span style=" font-style:italic;">something</span> bad was happening, but a change of monarchs was far away from what she was expecting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It had a way of getting to a pony. Especially when that pony and her family were royalty and might be…in the way. That was why when a light brown earth pony came up behind her, she jumped in surprise.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Quickly bowing, Mayor Mare apologized, “I am terribly sorry for startling you, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ugh. Please, Princess Cadance or just Cadance.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Very well then, Princess Cadance. I am Mayor Mare. I was hoping I could speak with you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s fine. I could use a distraction.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Does the name Luna mean anything to you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s not a distraction at all…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The mayor quickly bowed again, apologizing. “I am terribly sorry, princess. Please excuse me.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Wait,” Cadance said. “I didn’t mean I wasn’t willing to talk. Let’s relocate somewhere more private.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Cadance turned to Spike and Star Charmer and told them to stay put in no weak terms. Then she teleported herself and the mayor out of town.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">They arrived in a small grassy clearing just outside of the temporary housing tents.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, what did you wish to speak about…Mayor Mare, was it? I don’t mean to be rude, but is that your real name?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The mayor rubbed the back of her head with her hoof. “Yes… I have thought of changing it several times. Obviously my parents were not interested when I was young and it just never happened after that. Now I am the mayor, and a mare of course, so, you know.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I see. Anyways, what’s up?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I— Well, I really need somepony to talk to about this whole Nightmare Moon thing. I do not think I can do what I have to right now. And you looked pretty nervous too, so I thought I would ask if you knew what was going on so we could talk. If you do not mind, Princess Cadance.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, I could use somepony to talk to as well. I only found out recently and Shining has been super busy since then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Mayor Mare sighed in relief. Then following Cadance’s lead, she sat down to make herself more comfortable.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For the next hour, the two mares shared their worries and tried to find comfort in each other.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you sure this doesn’t go against the conditions Mayor Mare gave us?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’m as sure as I am that it ain’t zap apple season. I checked the wording and if we don’t actually fire this thing ourselves we’re fine.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo tried pushing their project and couldn’t so much as budge it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not very portable…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The way I see it, an archmage can lift this thing no problem.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I suppose. Do you think it’s even useful?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I don’t know. It probably can’t seriously hurt an alicorn, or Archmage Twilight even, but what I do know is Sweetie Belle is in trouble and needs help and we’ll give her everything we can. Wrench please.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo hoofed over a nearby wrench and we then immediately scolded for providing the wrong type. Apple Bloom got up and dug around in her toolkit for another seemingly identical wrench and vanished back under her contraption.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How did you even get the parts for this? Most of this stuff doesn’t get used outside of classroom demonstrations.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, with magitech around it kind of makes electricity pointless. Still has its uses though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sure, but where did you get all this stuff?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, right. I had Rarity make it. She was suspicious at first so I showed her my blueprints. When that didn’t help, I just told her it was to help keep her sister safe and she made everything on the spot. Capacitor banks. One at a time.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo lugged over several giant blocks of capacitors. The device seemingly devoured them as Apple Bloom brought each underneath it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She said it’d only last a few days but honestly I think this thing is only going to be good for a couple uses anyways.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Okay, I can buy that. But that leaves the most important question. How in Equestria did you come up with this?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Heh. I was wondering when you’d ask me that. I wouldn’t normally think about building a weapon. I at least have more sense than everypony in town seems to think. But Sweetie needs all the help she can get.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Honestly, I don’t understand most of the math. I got a physics book from the library and asked Cheerilee to help me understand the parts that were important for this.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The original idea I got back when we were playing with magnets in class a few months ago. I figured I could sort of make a magnet based train system. I never got anywhere with that since I met you two soon after and we had all sorts of fun.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A long, loud hum came from where Scootaloo presumed Apple Bloom was. Moments later what seemed to be a lightning bolt emerged and exited though a ground Apple Bloom had set up at the start of construction.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You okay, Apple Bloom?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah, just testing the capacitors. That bank worked.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A few dozen more lightning bolts came and went. Scootaloo was surprised Applejack or Big Mac hadn’t shown up yet. Or an angry mob with torches and pitchforks.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I did start reading about magnetism though. Let me tell you, the math went right over my head. Didn’t understand a thing about it. You know that my math grades soared just before summer break, right? I think I’m a few years ahead now with all the algebra I learned and I still got nothing. My knowledge is kinda patchwork though. Just enough to get by.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, the basic concepts are easy enough to learn. There’s only a few real core ideas to electricity and magnetism. The rest is just figuring out how to use them to do what you want.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, as I said, I first thought about floating trains and pushing them along. But there’s no reason we can’t do the same with anything else. We just need a big power source to make things go fast enough to puncture magic shields and that’s pretty easy to do when you make everything with magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I just hope we finished before Sweetie left to fight Nightmare Moon. I asked Archmage Twilight to stop by before she left. We’ll just have to hope she does.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo heard one final clank of parts falling into place.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I think it’s done. Let’s get ready to test it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo loaded a heavy piece of solid iron into the end of the Apple Blooms device. Meanwhile, it hummed with that same lightning building sound but several times louder.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Eventually, the humming died down and stopped altogether.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, Scootaloo. Safety check.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um. Anchored to the ground.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Check.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Pointed somewhere not important.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Mountain peak, check.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Earplugs, weather factory strength.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Put them on after this.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Behind a…what’s this?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A Faraday Cage. It’s this wire mesh we’ve got here. It will protect us if the charge gets out of control.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Blast screen. Blast screen?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“In case it blows up. It’s the giant lump of metal in the center of the cage. We stand behind it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ten meter pole?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, we legally need the archmage now. I was hoping to finish sooner and have Applejack press the button.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So not needed then. Goggles.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Check.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Potential blast radius clear.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What was that?” Twilight said, having just teleported in, Magic on her head.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie dropped her clipboard with the checklist and Apple Bloom nearly dropped the extra pair of goggles and earplugs she was holding.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Are you two utterly unable to learn your lesson?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Apple Bloom’s response was to give Twilight a pair of goggles and ear plugs.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We understood completely,” Apple Bloom said. “We can build this but can’t use it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight face hoofed. She immediately regretted going so, she had gone nearly a week without a face hoof.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do I need to teach you two about the difference between the spirit of the law and the word of the law?” Apple Bloom and Scootaloo smiled sweetly up at Twilight. “No, obviously not. Rather a talking to about not abusing the word at the expense of the spirit.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight signed and then continued, “I guess that can wait. What is that behemoth that you’ve made here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um, it doesn’t really have a name. Kind of an oversight, if a minor one. Any ideas, Scootaloo?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, we could just call it by its description. It has a long rail, and it’s a gun, so railgun.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You made a weapon!” Twilight shouted. “What were you… How did…” Twilight took a minute to clam herself down. “I will expect full disclosure later, but I don’t have time for this now. Don’t you dare fire that thing. I’m taking you to Applejack—”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Whoa there! We built this for you and Sweetie Belle.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">That knocked Twilight off her hooves. It was obvious in hindsight since Apple Bloom had asked her to come, but it was still surprising.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Apple Bloom thinks it’ll be strong enough to break any shields Nightmare Moon can make.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Now Twilight was curious. She was short on time but she couldn’t just leave this be.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Why do you think that? I’m honestly surprised you’ve managed to build that…railgun at all, leaving alone whether it works or not. Looking around I’m even willing to believe you were safe doing it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“We totally were,” Scootaloo said. “Apple Bloom’s some kind of genius.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So you came up with this?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah. The basic idea is pretty primitive. It just hurls a chunk of metal really fast with electrical currents. I gave Cheerilee some ‘random’ numbers to do the math for me and she said the speed will be on the kilometers per second scale. It still needs a test fire though, if you would be so kind.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight stood stunned and gaping.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, we’ll give this a shot. What precautions have you taken so far?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Scootaloo gave Twilight the safety checklist. Looking it over, Twilight seemed very impressed and even whistled at the end.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, now I completely believe you were safe doing this. I guess that explains why none of you have been seriously hurt yet as Crusaders. Except for that time with Sweetie Belle, but that was partly my fault.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Give me a second and I’ll set up some barriers and a shielded target. I’ll check the ‘potential blast radius’ too.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A purple barrier rose up and surrounded the three ponies inside the Faraday Cage. Twilight also added a sound proof barrier and threw away her goggled and ear plugs prompting the fillies to do the same.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">In the distance, Twilight fixed a medium sized patch of dirt in the air where Apple Bloom said the railgun would hit. She then surrounded it with a Magic enhanced set of shield protecting against physical attacks. She even put up several slowing spells. It seemed like cheating but that was the kind of thing you have to expect your opponents to do.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Alright, how do I set this thing off?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“There’s three big buttons on the control panel. The green one builds up a charge, the blue one lets the charge dissipate and the red one fires.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The three gathered behind the blast shield and Twilight pushed the big red button. Of course, being inside Twilight’s wards, they heard nothing, but they certainly felt the vibrations moving through the ground.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Apple Bloom looked through the thick glass window inlaid in the blast shield and gasped. Scootaloo shoved her out of the way to get a look for herself and was similarly taken. Twilight surveyed the entire area with a spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The target was still there, although the shield protecting it was not. Twilight had felt it be punctured and then break when she didn’t repair it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Indeed the target was still there, but not all of it. A hole in the shape of the iron Scootaloo had loaded earlier passed right through it without any imperfections.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Apple Bloom, did you happen to get Cheerilee to give you a range estimate?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um… It sort of had to take the curvature of the planet into account…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, alicorns are indestructible, but I think this might be going a bit too far.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Yep…” Apple Bloom agreed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A minute of stunned silence later, Twilight spoke again. “Apple Bloom?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you have any ideas for peaceful inventions?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“A few.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Interesting…” Twilight looked down at Apple Bloom. “Looks like you got your cutie mark.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Huh?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Applebloom and Scootaloo both stared at her flank and saw a zap apple complete with small sparks there and both started bouncing around in glee.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ll leave you two to your fun.” Twilight summoned some paper and scribbled on it. “Here’s a note for Applejack and Big Macintosh exonerating you; they’re headed this way. Along with about a dozen guards. I’ll take care of the latter.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight disappeared in another teleport while Apple Bloom and Scootaloo continued to celebrate.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Daisy was back home. With any luck, whatever happened her relative unimportance should keep her safe.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She did feel bad about leaving, but she would only be a distraction.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Princess Celestia said that Daisy could do whatever she wanted after this. Continuing her life in Manehattan or coming back to Canterlot to help out.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It should have been an easy choice. She was getting older and needed peace and quiet.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But Daisy had gotten a little taste of adventure and power and truly great magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was addicting.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Rarity, Cheerilee, and Bon Bon had managed to get a table at the Sugarcube Corner and were in no rush to leave.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Since their first impromptu get together that seemed like ages ago, the trio had been spending more and more time together. Fluttershy joined in occasionally when Rarity forced her to be social, but was often too busy with her animals to come to town.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Tonight, the mares had ordered a large cake that they fully intended to finish by themselves, even if none of them could stand the sight of it anymore.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So,” Bon Bon said, trying to get her mind away from the cake, “yesterday I got Lyra to tell me exactly what their group has been doing the past month.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Really? I guess it is okay to talk about it now considering we are only an hour away from Nightmare Moon’s return.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Nightmare Moon?” Cheerilee asked. “Like, the one from Nightmare Night?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I am sure the tale has been embellished a lot, but yes. They are going to actually fight her, not give her candy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, there is just so much to explain. We might very well talk through her return. If you would, Bon Bon. You have the latest information.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anything to avoid more cake.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh horsefeathers. I should have thought of that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, it is too late now.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Bon Bon began her very long recounting of Lyra’s adventures, leaving her comrades to finish the cake alone.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">General Otto’s office was much like the stallion himself: neat, tidy, and ready for service.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">He had a white coat with a light blue mane and tail which had a streak of black in it. His cutie mark was a chess king and he was in surprisingly good shape for a stallion of his rather old age.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">He was widely considered the greatest military commander Equestria had yet produced. General Otto also dismissed it as faint praise considering how peaceful Equestria was, but he enjoyed the complements all the same. After all, it was mostly his fault that Equestria was so peaceful to begin with.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was once a rumor floating around that he was the power behind the throne. Even today, some ponies still believed that. Once there was some truth to that. He often served as an ambassador in addition to being a general — and several other positions of note — which let him set much of Equestria’s foreign policy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But then Twilight Sparkle came along and claimed most of his responsibilities along with the important powers of several other ponies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At first he had been as outraged as the rest of the nobility. He never saw the problem with her being a commoner. She had <span style=" font-style:italic;">earned</span> everything she got and that was exactly how he ran the army. He just wanted what was taken from him back.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">However, his temper cooled quickly as it should for any good general. He soon started to enjoy all of the free time he suddenly had and spent a lot of time with his neglected family.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It wasn’t long before he was glad the young archmage took most of his troubles away and left him with the one position he truly enjoyed.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But around two years ago, she had done something unforgivable. She recruited Espionage. Oh, he was certainly good at his job. Perhaps the best even. But he had this incessant need to micromanage.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It drove General Otto mad every time he came in for another bucking update on how things were going. Often, he would throw the cursed stallion out of the room and tell him to read the standard report to EIS.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But today, Espionage was having none of that. He kept prattling on and on about making sure the troops were in line and ready to defend the borders and asking if any seemed to be plotting a coup or counter-coup.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">General Otto had naturally been informed about the Nightmare Moon situation. He was a bit annoyed that it was only a few days ago, but he could respect the need for secrecy.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Similarly, he understood Espionage’s concerns, even if they were trivial, so he put up with them and answered all of his questions.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">When the spy finally left, General Otto leaned back in his chair and relight the pipe he had been smoking before Espionage had appeared.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">General Otto was done with politics. He had decided that long ago. He was as fond of Princess Celestia as any other pony off the street, but she was just a ruler. They came and they went. Perhaps Equestria had a little bit less of the coming and going in the last millennium or so, but change was inevitable.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For now, he would just wait to see whose armies he would be commanding.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie is impressed. The magical density here is amazing. How did you managed to fit this many spells this strong into such a small space?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">So far Celestia had been avoiding a fit of guilt by not talking to Trixie but this was pushing her limits. Pinkie had also been instructed in no uncertain terms that she was not to act on any emotions she read at the old castle. Still, she managed to proceed with only a small frown.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Twilight gave me all the organizational details for our trap.” Celestia shot Twilight a quick glance. “It would seem she has gotten quite good at working with dense magic. I can not imagine why she would need to.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Out of the corner of her own eye, she could see Twilight rolling hers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Trixie supposes she could hear an answer from Twilight.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Ehhh… It’s kind of technical. Not really fit for just before an ambush.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“The Great and Bored Trixie demands entertainment. We have at least an hour before Nightmare Moon shows up. It’s not like there’s anything else we have to do.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“…Fine. Does anypony else want in on this. I’m not explaining twice.” Lyra and Pinkie joined the group. “Pinkie? Really?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yeah! Magic’s cool stuff!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight raised an eyebrow but concluded that understanding Pinkie would require being Pinkie. The four moved a bit away from the group and Twilight got into lecturing mode.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Meanwhile, Sweetie Belle nervously edged closer to Celestia. She was concentrating really hard on not hearing the princess’s thoughts.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She must have been concentrating a bit harder than she thought because Celestia pointed it out. “You do not have to try so hard Sweetie Belle. I will not trouble you with my thoughts again. You do not know any languages other than Modern Equestria, right?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Um…no. I just wanted to… Well, to apologize. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop on you that day.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do not worry about it. When my sister and I freed this land from Discord, one of the laws we put into effect allows bearers of the elements to use their element’s power unfettered. You are free to use Generosity as you see fit. I know how wrong it feels to take it off.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You mean Generosity used to be yours?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Along with Magic and Loyalty.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Do you have any tips for me? Twilight’s been helpful, but she doesn’t really seem to get Generosity’s wonts and moods.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">This was perhaps the sweetest distraction from being in the same room as Trixie Celestia could have asked for.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Sure. Maybe you could call Dash here early and I could help her too.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie paused a moment to reach out to Dash’s mind.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“She says she’s still busy.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, we can just amuse ourselves then.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Now Celestia too got into her lecturing mode and starting helping Sweetie get to know Generosity more deeply.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s and Celestia’s group managed to pass their free hour in the blink of an eye. They were pulled out a their conversations by a disturbance in the magical field of the castle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie immediately called Dash back who appeared near instantly. Celestia prepared to start triggering spells while the bearers got into formation and started powering up the elements, hoping they weren’t starting too early; they never managed to hold a charge for more than a second or two before it dissipated.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Magic flew wildly in the throne room as Luna’s banishment ended. Twilight worried for a moment that Celestia’s spells would be torn apart by the magical flux or solidified and rendered inert by a density spike.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A quick glance around told her Celestia was somehow holding them together so Twilight turned her attention back to controlling the elements.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">With a final burst, Luna appeared, fully armored, her mane and tail blue and star filled, and as tall as Celestia. She was just as she had appeared in the book Spike found a month ago.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She also was defenseless and numerous wards prevented her from teleporting out, just as Celestia promised. The princess triggered most of her traps to hold her sister for the time needed to let the elements finish charging.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight thought she could see a few tears in Celestia’s eyes, but it was too early for a touching reunion. Why would she—</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And then Twilight learned something new about the Traditional Royal Canterlot Voice.</p>

<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Chapter Nine - Luna</p>
<p align="center" style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">“Very well, I will do as you ask.”</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had heard the Traditional Royal Canterlot Voice several times in her life. Twice recently. Once from Celestia and once from Luna.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The traditional voice was loud for a reason. Celestia, and presumably Luna as well, used it on occasion when magically dispersing her voice would not do.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Of course the physics behind it also made it loud as well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">What Twilight didn’t know, was it was the normal speaking volume for alicorns. Celestia and Luna either went around whispering or magically dampening their voices to reach a normal pony level.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And now, Luna was in pain.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And screaming.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">If Luna had deafened Twilight, everything might have worked out. But even the loudest Canterlot voice didn’t cause ear trauma.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight heard every single moment of Luna’s wail and her heart reached out to her friend as soon as she realized what she was hearing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She felt her control over the elements slip away from her even as Luna’s own magic grew without limit and fought to escape her bonds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Groping desperately to regain control of the elements, Twilight felt the power slip away from her and fade completely.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The other bearers were still dazed by the element’s gestalt as they always were and Twilight was clearly not in any shape to do anything. Celestia made a snap decision to escape with the group to a more secure location.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her horn glowed even brighter as she diverted some of her strength to building up the power needed for a group teleport, but she was too late.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna released an explosive amount of magic solidifying many of Celestia’s traps and wards including the teleport blocks. With the surge, she also managed to get off a smaller teleport spell for two.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna was gone.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was gone.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Celestia was in trouble.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight broke out of her daze to find she was…somewhere. From the design of the stone walls and columns, it seemed like she was in a castle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The stone was strangely textured and white in color. The carpeting had blue and black motifs and all manner of paintings, tapestries, and sculptures were placed around the room and in halls exiting it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">A grand doorway lay before Twilight at the other end of the room and much a smaller set of double doors lay behind her.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The whole building seemed to be lit by small, light-blue balls of light placed like torches around the castle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Twilight!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sweetie Belle?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Finally, you responded. Are you all right?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Seems like it. Does Dash know where I am?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">…Yeah. Are you sure you want to know?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Of course.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">You’re on the moon.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight looked around for any windows but there were none nearby. She didn’t want to risk blind teleporting into a wall, or the ground, or into space, so she decided to take Dash at her word.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s pretty cool. Wish I could visit under better circumstances. Any chance of a rescue?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I’m going to quote Celestia word for word. ‘My sister is probably very tired from what she just did, at least in the sense that alicorns get tired. However, trying to fight her on the moon, or even just to fetch you, would be an instantaneous defeat.’</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That seems fair. Has there been any coups or anything?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Not as far as I know. Celestia does want to know if you have any other secret backup plans she should be dealing with right now.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Nope. I’ve got nothing. I’m surprisingly okay with having the reins torn from me. I guess check in once and a while and I can tell you what Luna and I are up to.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I’ll check in every five minutes.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Um…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I can do more if you want.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No, that’s fine. Just, you don’t need to check that often. I’m fine right now so I’ll probably be fine for a long period of time.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">…alright. I’ll let you know if we come up with anything.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s not a good idea Sweetie. I’m a security liability up here. Keep any clever plans to yourself.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It almost sounded like Sweetie was mumbling, but that’s not how Generosity worked. Still, it couldn’t hurt to check.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Did you say something?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No, but… Twilight, Lyra’s not saying it, but she keeps thinking something in the back of her mind.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I’m positive I know what she’s thinking. It’s my policy to not answer questions pertaining to comparative friendship.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight almost thought Sweetie had abruptly left, but then her voice came back again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I’ll talk to you later then.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight said her goodbye and then she was alone in her mind again. At least as far as she could tell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Now, Twilight had a castle to explore. It looked ancient but was amazingly well preserved. The old castle in the Everfree was crumbling from disrepair, but this one seemed to be just like the day it was made.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It didn’t take long to explore most of the surprisingly small castle. Twilight did manage to tear herself away from the library with difficulty. The library was massive, but she could spend years lost in it. She could come back to each after finishing her exploration.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">At the top of the castle she found an observatory. She briefly thought about stopping here to star gaze; the stars would be gorgeous without an atmosphere in the way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">No atmosphere? </span>Twilight paused to consider that contradiction. <span style=" font-style:italic;">How am I breathing? There’s definitely not atmosphere on most of the moon.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight’s horn flared for a few minutes as she looked for spells placed on the castle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, Luna. You can call me impressed. You’ve built up a small little ecosystem on the moon. One that lasted a thousand years unmanaged. Very impressive.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight teleported outside the castle to get a better look and made an extremely close call, appearing just above a tree.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight panicked and flung herself upwards completely forgetting that she weighed much less on the moon. She panicked again when she remembered that the bubble of protection spells didn’t extend very far up and flung herself back down towards a pond.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After slamming into the pond and making perhaps the most magnificent splash in history, Twilight was very glad the pond was deeper than it looked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Walking on the moon wasn’t too difficult, after a few horrible failures, but it seemed self-telekinesis was going to take some work.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight swam out of the pond and in the back of her mind was pleased to verify that the buoyant force worked exactly like she thought it should. Twilight dried herself off, threw the water back into the pond, and then looked up.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">What she saw would have driven some geometers insane. There were no stars, at least not on this side of the moon. It was too bright for that with the first pinpricks of sunlight appearing from nowhere.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">However, Equus was beautifully and <span style=" font-style:italic;">fully</span> visible, faintly glowing with reflected moonlight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">But… How? It’s a sphere…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had known that during the day and night, the appropriate celestial body was visible from everywhere on Equus, although seen in different positions. She had <span style=" font-style:italic;">tried</span> to understand the geometry to make that work, but she had never been able to come up with anything. Nor had she been able to visualize it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Argh! I don’t understand!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">As Twilight frantically tried to put together any consistent theory for what she was seeing, the sun began to appear from nowhere. With less atmosphere to shield her, it was even brighter than normal and she averted her eyes completely.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Casting a darkening spell, Twilight turned back to get a real look at the sun. It was as alienly shaped as Equus, although it didn’t seem to show much more of itself to Twilight than if she looked at it from home.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There was precious little time to study the sun, for as mysteriously as it had appeared, it disappeared along with Equus.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Or perhaps the moon had disappeared. Disappeared to the strange place it went when the moon was set.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Again, Twilight was overcome with surprise for the moon hadn’t left alone. In the much fainter light of the moon, she could see millions of stars mosaicked across the sky, distorted from how they appeared on Equus, but otherwise recognizable.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Except, as Twilight had suspected, their beauty was a hundred times more provocative and the colors infinitely more intense. All manner of normally unseen formations decorated the sky: galaxies, nebulae, star clusters, quasars.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">How long Twilight stared at the stars, she did not know. Wherever she was, there was no way to tell time easily. Perhaps there was some trick Luna knew, but Twilight still hadn’t seen so much as a shed hair of the alicorn.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Interrupted by her growling stomach, Twilight paid a visit to one of the apple trees she had seen before. Twilight jumped all the way up to the tree’s branches and plucked three apples with her hooves.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The moon was nothing if not interesting. Munching on her first apple, Twilight was struck with the idea of skipping back to the castle in giant bounds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">After the first several leaps, Twilight began adding flips to her skips, seeing how many times she could rotate without breaking stride. After breaking ten in a single go Twilight shouted at the peak of her next jump, “The moon!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then on the next peak, “Is so!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Much!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Fun!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight arrived at the castle and jumped from wall to wall to reach the roof and looked out upon the entire castle grounds.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">For the first time in at least a decade, if not her entire life, Twilight actually felt like her age, bouncing around in youthful glee. She decided to give the library a miss and finish her apples on the roof, staring at the stars again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Long after her apples were gone, Sweetie came in again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Twilight?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Hey, Sweetie. How’s it going on Equus?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">We’re fine. Nightmare Moon hasn’t done anything bad to you, has she?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I haven’t even seen her. She might not even be on the moon.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">What’s it like up there?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">In Dash’s terms, it’s twenty percent more awesome than Equus. There’s moon ponies that grow moon food and live in moon houses and everything is just all around better. The moon cheese is especially delicious.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">R— Really?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Heh heh. No. But it is pretty great up here. The low gravity is very entertaining and the stars are, simply put, stunning. Luna does have a castle and a small ecosystem up here too. I haven’t seen anything alive other than plants though. How did the Summer Sun Celebration go?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">We didn’t make it. We’ve been gathering potential hostages and moving them into sa—</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie cut off abruptly for a minute before coming back in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sorry about that. I remembered that you didn’t want information and I might have accidentally thought about where we’ve been. I had Lyra temporarily block those memories for me.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight was a bit disgusted at the use of a memory spell, but let it pass. It had been a good idea on Sweetie’s part and Twilight was not going to discourage her student from good ideas.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sweetie, this is very important, so listen carefully. You need to work out some way to let yourself know if you in the past had reason to suspect a memory spell was used on you. More importantly, it must be subtle and never tell anypony what it is.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">You’re smart, Sweetie. I’m sure you can figure out why. Consider both homework.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Uuuu…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Don’t forget your regular exercises too.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Really…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Me being on the moon doesn’t mean you should bring your education to a halt. Oh, and have Trixie teach you a simple illusion spell and practice making it look realistic.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Nopony else has homework during a…what was it…a state of national crisis…</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">If that’s how you feel, tell Cheerilee that I would like her to start teaching Apple Bloom as much math as she can. I’m sure you’ve picked the two of them up by now.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That is </span>not<span style=" font-style:italic;"> what I meant </span>at all<span style=" font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Well, you’ll just have to put up with complaining about me with Apple Bloom then.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I will!</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Sweetie somehow managed to give Twilight a feeling of her stomping off. Apparently Sweetie Belle had been learning new tricks with Generosity. Probably from Celestia.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Sweetie? You still there? Oh, well.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight got up and jumped off the roof. At the bottom she slowed herself somewhat clumsily to get a soft landing. The moon really was a great place.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Heading to the library, Twilight decided it was time to stop playing around and start actually thinking.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Alright, so do I have any means of getting off the moon?</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">External help: not coming.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Teleports: It would take me months to cover that distance, and I have no idea what happens if I leave the moon while it’s…here.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Cheating: I can’t get a connection to anything on Equus so I don’t have access to the global battery. Not that I’d use it for something this minor.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Cheating Revised: The magical background here is incredibly high. But it would take at least a week to etch enough spell circles to have enough power to teleport far enough. Luna would notice by then.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Luna: No idea where she is and she was the one that brought me here anyways.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Dimensional Gate: Same power limitations as teleports. Also Luna would notice long before I finished.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">A Space Vessel: Same time and directional issues as teleporting.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Conclusion: Stuck.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Right. I suppose that’s not really surprising since I’ve been left alone with no restraints.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight entered the library and started idly browsing the book titles on the shelves. She found one that seemed interesting and opened it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Of course, Old Equestrian. These will take forever to read.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight put the book back on the shelf and returned to browsing. It didn’t look good enough to justify plowing through a pile of outdated language misery.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I should probably answer the question of why I am here.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">There’s the obvious answer of why I’m not in Equestria. Split up the elements and Luna just needs to wait for Celestia to make a mistake.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">That’s in line with not simply killing one of us. Grim as it is, we’re more easily replaced than rescued.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">But why me specifically? I am troublesome. Sweetie would be easier to deal with. Or Dash, the only one of us that’s…well…not a unicorn or Pinkie Pie.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Does Luna sufficiently value my friendship that she would try harder to grab me despite the risk? If so, her valuing my friendship would minimize worse case scenarios.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I don’t really see her going out of her way for that though. Unless she intends to play this very slowly and carefully. Boredom can ruin plans pretty easily.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">I suppose it also would get me out of the way. I can’t do much on the moon and can’t really risk knowing what’s going on.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">It could have been a random pick. But then again, that risks trying to drag Celestia along which certainly would not have worked out. I’ll call that weak evidence against.</span></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight pulled out a book on the Discordian era and sat down at a table.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;"><span style=" font-style:italic;">Why do I even care? I’m out of the game unless I find something Luna wants enough to let me go. I’ll just read for now and enjoy my time off.</span></p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was four days before Twilight met with Luna again, even in the dream world. During that time, Twilight hadn’t been able to ignore everything and just read like she wanted. Yet she had come up with only two viable ideas and both were extremely stupid.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The first, Twilight would never have thought of if she hadn’t gotten to know Luna so well. After first laughing for a solid minute and then scolding herself for being dumb, Twilight discarded the idea of seducing Luna.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her other idea was even more ridiculous, but it didn’t require Twilight to humiliate <span style=" font-style:italic;">herself</span> so she passed it on to Sweetie anyways.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There is exactly one force in the universe that is absolutely irresistible. So impossibly powerful that it can not be escaped.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Heartsongs.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight avoided any situation that could develop into a heartsong as well as she could. She had only been dragged into one in her life, but one was already one too many.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">To begin with, Twilight couldn’t sing, and never bothered to learn how to dance. The perfectly choreographed musical numbers and the crystal clear voice of every singer always gave her the willies.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The one time she had been in a heartsong, it had felt like a malevolent puppet master had seized control of her to make her sing and dance for its amazement. She never wanted to be in one ever again.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Even Luna wouldn’t be able to resist the call of the song. If they could trap her in one, especially a long one, then Celestia would have plenty of time to pop off to the moon, pick Twilight up, and come back. Maybe even have time to use the elements if things worked out especially well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But heartsongs were tricky things that ran on emotional highs. A few had been recorded as successfully engineered, but most likely, that was a tiny drop in an ocean of failed attempts. Even if every attempt had been recorded, there were far, far more recorded failures than recorded successes.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, maybe with Kindness and Pinkie’s inexplicable abilities, and a lot of luck, they could make it work.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But that was a future concern. Luna was still on the moon and in the library where Twilight had made herself at home. Luna had appeared in the same style of teleport that Celestia used, although the light was a bit dimmer when it coalesced.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna had forgone the larger Nightmare Moon look in favor of the smaller sized version Twilight met in her dreams.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Blegh! I swear, real bodies get sore so easily,” Luna said, stretching muscle after muscle.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You could just live in dreams,” offered Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I’ve thought about it before, but it’s unsatisfying being omnipotent and I’m not moving to a world where somepony else is.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well darn, there goes my master plan.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Was that what you were laughing so hard about the night we came here?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, that was— You heard that?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep. It sounds kind of creepy but I know everything that goes on on the moon. It’s all normally in what amounts to peripheral vision but it’s hard not to pay attention to the only thing moving.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well, if you know what I’ve been doing, what have you been up to?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Resting. That ambush hurt and escaping it was exhausting after just coming back from banishment. Still, good try.” Luna finished stretching shifted her attention to preening her wings.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I recognized the spells as my sister’s hoofwork, but if nothing else, their arrangement was definitely all you. I’m almost unbearably curious what you’re planning that you <span style=" font-style:italic;">need</span> more than that density for a spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Anyways, I was planning to knock out the important spells but I figured I’d be more likely to escape if I just started solidifying them. Even if it took a lot more effort. Probably still lucky I won the race though.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What race? You cheated.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna looked up from her wings quizzically.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“You destabilized the charge we were building with the elements.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“With that blast of raw magic? Hardly likely. The elements’s gestalt can stand up to way more than that.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna worked a bit more on her primary feathers before looking up again to see Twilight with her face buried in a hoof resting on the table, shaking her head.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">She reviewed what she could remember of that night, but Luna couldn’t remember doing anything other than exploding with magic.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">And screaming. Celestia’s spells did hurt like being eaten by an ursa major. Which Luna would never let happen again, no matter how many times she was dared.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Can’t remember anything else I did. Are you sure you didn’t just mess up?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight turned to look Luna in the eyes and answered, “Of course I messed up. Your darn screaming ruined everything.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What?” Luna’s eyes showed sudden understanding as she giggled. “No way. You mean I beat your friendship canon with friendship?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight let her head hit the table.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Oh, that is priceless! I will tease you about that forever.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Talking into the table, Twilight’s voice came out as a monotone mumble. “Ha ha. It’s very funny. I should have listened to Lyra and just shoved you into a corner of my dreams.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s no way to speak about a <span style=" font-style:italic;">friend</span>. And just think of all the <span style=" font-style:italic;">friendly</span> things we did that you would have missed out on. You know, when you were hanging out with your <span style=" font-style:italic;">friend</span>, in a <span style=" font-style:italic;">friends</span> only world for <span style=" font-style:italic;">friends</span>.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight groaned for Luna to stop and she complied by switching to rolling around laughing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Eventually, Luna recovered from her fit and went back to fussing with her feathers.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“How did you even know I was the element of magic anyways?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I had no idea. That was a completely unintended bonus. I was pretty surprised when I found out from watching your dreams before we actually met, but I suppose in retrospect it was an obvious sort of choice for my sister.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Then why were you even bothering with me?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I spent the years leading up to today talking to ponies of importance. Not asking them to do anything, or be my friend, or anything like that. Just encouraging them to be neutral to whatever happened. I don’t really want to wait five or more generations for ponies to stop thinking I’m an evil usurper.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I figure my sister never actually officially stripped me of my position, but that means very little when dealing with ponies. The best transfer of power would be a seemingly peaceful one. I could just say my sister and I switched places in our celestial duties.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“But I need a real legitimizing claim that everypony could see. A symbol of the old reign’s willing participation.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Who better than the archmage who also happened to be Celestia’s best, if not only, friend?” Twilight finished for Luna.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yep. Honestly, it took me forever to even realize you existed. You seem to have a lot of ponies around you that would rather pretend you don’t exist. Especially in dreams.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So who finally told you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“General Otto, if you can believe it. He had a lot of good things to say about you. And an awful lot of complaints. Especially about somepony called Espionage. But apparently he wasn’t much interested in politics anymore so I just listened to his problems and then went on my merry way.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I decided to spend the rest of my banishment befriending you. I knew my sister was fond of hiding things so I was going to use that to try and separate you two but by the time I got to you, you already knew everything.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Still, you were an important piece to win, so I went ahead and tried anyways. Obviously, I never got my sister out of your head, but I never really tried. I couldn’t imagine that ending well.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Still, things worked out pretty well for me it would seem.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What if I don’t want to be your archmage?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well. I generally don’t make threats: I find them rather tasteless. But if I send my sister packing to the sun, I’m the only one powerful enough to set her free.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna raised a hoof to stop Twilight from interrupting. “You could, of course, find some way to hit me with the elements, but I’m sure my sister told you that I have more power right now than is natural for me. I would lose that and she would be stuck for quite a long time — centuries perhaps — before I could manage to regain it safely.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“I could just do it myself.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“And lose your one chance at casting whatever spell it is you’re researching. There’s no poker face in the universe good enough for you to make me believe you would do that for any reason less than saving your own life.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight scowled under her breath. It was an obvious bluff, but Luna could have at least had the decency to pretend to be shocked.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Besides, it’s not as if Equestria will be any better with you protesting.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“That’s not at all why I took the job and keep it.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s still true though. So why did you take it? You do the job well obviously, but I can’t imagine it’s fun for you.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“It’s not. I do it for…” Twilight knew exactly what Luna was going to say if she actually gave her reasoning. But that awkward pause was enough for her to guess anyways.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“So, you did it because you two are <span style=" font-style:italic;">friends</span>. Well, we’re <span style=" font-style:italic;">friends</span> too. I think we’ve established that pretty well only a few days ago. You wouldn’t want to disappoint a <span style=" font-style:italic;">friend</span>, would you?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight let her head hit the table again. “You really are going to do that forever…”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Naturally,” Luna said, standing up and spreading her wings. Testing them with a few flaps, Luna hovered in the air a few hooves up. “Now, I think I’m going to go stretch my wings for a bit.”</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna collapsed in a huff on a cloud above the moon’s lonely lake. Twilight had taken a faux alicorn form with Polymorph and was clumsily flying around in low gravity above the water, just in case she had a spectacular failure.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">Two weeks. Two whole weeks we’ve been playing this stupid game of cat and mouse.</span>” Luna was using the traditional voice because she didn’t feel like flying over to where Twilight was fluttering.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Without a similar ability, Twilight carried her voice to Luna with magic. “If you’re tired of chasing Celestia from one fortress of solitude to another, you could just kiss and make up.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">Bah. She has to run out eventually. I’m knocking one down every day. She’d have to absorb a lot of the Equestria’s resources to outpace me and I would notice that.</span>”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Well you’re not the only pony that’s frustrated.” Twilight gestured towards Equus, currently in the sky, with her hoof and her wing went with it sending her into a sluggish nose dive. After recovering, she continued, “I have had zero luck trying to develop a set of axioms that describes that optical nightmare.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">Why are you even bothering?</span>”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Because it makes no sense! I can see every part of the planet from here! It’s round! I personally have circumnavigated it!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">You can see the moon and sun from everywhere on the planet. It should be obvious that you can see all of Equus from the moon.</span>”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Yes, it is obvious. But that doesn’t mean it makes any sense. Geometers have tried for a few centuries now — and I can’t imagine what they thought before then — to reconcile Equus’s local geometry with the heavens’s, but nothing ever works out. I thought maybe with a good view, inspiration might hit me, but I have nothing.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">Can’t it just be different?</span>”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight landed on Luna’s cloud with a soft thud. “No! I had given up and thought just that! But I’m in the heavens! And everything here behaves exactly as it does on Equus. There <span style=" font-style:italic;">must</span> be a single set of rules describing everything.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“<span style=" font-weight:600;">And— </span>And what do you expect to get out of knowing?”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“Catharsis.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna started at Twilight with eyebrow raised.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“What? That’s a perfectly valid reason.”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna kept staring but said nothing.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">“No, really. I’ve got nothing else. Once understood, there’d probably be interesting applications in spacial magic, but I have no idea what they’d be.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna kept staring until Twilight went back to flying in the huff she came in on. Luna shrugged and laid down for a nap.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna appeared in her light based teleport and could hear Twilight’s laughter echo throughout the castle. Apparently that filly bearing the element of generosity had already relayed what happened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna burst down the doors leading to her bedroom and threw off the clothes she had inexplicably obtained. She flopped onto her bed utterly drunk, determined to pretend today never happened.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was hard to do with a purple unicorn shouting, “It worked! I can’t believe it worked!”</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna buried her head in her pillows and pretended she didn’t just perform a song and dance with her sister and the terror of the dream world.</p>
<p align="center" style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">#</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">It was finally time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna had just finished knocking out the defenses on her sister’s last hideout. There had been a few minor setbacks along the way. Like that heartsong a little more than a week ago. The tune was so catchy that she couldn’t get it out of her head ever since.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Overall though, everything had gone smoothly. Her sister was always on the defensive and distracted by ruling a nation remotely. Besides her, there were only two other ponies actively trying to match wits with Luna: Twilight and Lyra Heartstrings.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had effectively given up, much to Luna’s relief. From her experience, The archmage only proposed solutions she thought capable of working and never hesitated to try them. Even ones that were stupid and humiliating.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna was positive that the real problems in her campaign originated solely from Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Lyra Heartstrings, on the other hoof, quickly demonstrated to Luna that she was the kind of pony that fought to the bitter end with every absurd trick she could think of. Even if said tricks had no chance of helping.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The exploding runes had been…interesting when they almost sent Luna home with a scorched coat. The pit traps had been insulting. The bucket of water had been infuriating. And those were just the highlights.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, Luna had learned a thousand years ago the importance of remaining calm and not rising to provocations. If that was Lyra’s plan, it certainly wasn’t going to work.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Then again, maybe she was just buying time to let Twilight think, since Luna stubbornly was refusing to knock out Twilight for a month or more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Or perhaps she was stalling for something entirely different.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna had worried that the extended delaying tactics <span style=" font-style:italic;">were</span> actually dangerous. That was how she got trapped in the heartsong when she overextended. By a sheer stroke of luck, her sister had been trapped in it too, preventing her from recovering Twilight.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">There were only two things Luna could think of for which buying time would be useful. Besides more time to think that is.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">First was if her sister was trying out the more interesting aspects of magic available to alicorns. Of course, her sister was far too much of a strict and proper pony to dabble in such affairs, so that couldn’t be it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The other was if somepony was trying to understand Twilight’s global battery spell. With Twilight on the moon, it wouldn’t be hard to wrest control of it and use it.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">But there was nothing Luna could do about that unless she wanted to risk getting stuck in another heartsong, so she continued her slower and safer approach to back her sister into a corner.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her fear proved to be unfounded when Luna finally forced her sister to retreat and prepare for a final confrontation. Surely if somepony were working on stealing Twilight’s spell, her sister would have retreated to the sun since the final battle wouldn’t buy much time.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna followed her sister into the frozen reaches north of Equestria where nopony would be bothered by their fighting.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Truthfully, Luna would have preferred a fight near a populated area. Her sister was the kind of fighter that didn’t understand the term ‘collateral damage’, while Luna herself was a precision spellcaster. Especially when the only spell she needed to actually hit with was the banishment spell.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, she had no interest in letting her sister hole up in the arctic or on the sun, so she might as well give up the choice of location. It wouldn’t matter. Her greatest opponent would be overconfidence.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna was more powerful, but not so much more powerful than her sister to make sport of her. This was entirely her fight to lose. Especially since her banishment gave her sister two advantages: a more modern knowledge of magic and the chance to become her senior in combat by centuries.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Twilight had complained about something called The Alicorn Accord before, but that still left plenty of wars for her sister to practice in.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Her sister stood looking like she wanted to talk, but Luna wasn’t going to have any of that. If she had anything important to say, the message would have been relayed through Twilight long ago.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna engaged her sister with a trick she picked up watching Twilight amuse herself on the moon.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Skeletal Spells were by no means the most interesting thing Luna had learned from Twilight, but they were the most practical. She could fire off dozens of spell fragments in the time it took to fully power a single one. Adding parallel casting to that and Luna could fling thousands of spells around without any difficulty.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">The best part was each one took very little magic to build the skeleton and could be finished remotely if it actually hit. It took longer overall to cast a single spell, and more magic to power it remotely, but the vastly increased rate of fire more than made up for the drawbacks.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Still, it didn’t matter how many spells Luna could send out at once if none of them hit. Her sister teleported out of the way of the skeletal teleport blocks Luna had cast.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna gathered from her stories that Twilight’s favorite combat trick was stealth teleporting. While teleports still were perfectly effective for dodging, alicorns were too powerful to hide.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:36px;">Luna wheeled around to face her sister behind her in time to deflect an explosion spell which flew into the ground and created a kilometer wide crater.</p>
