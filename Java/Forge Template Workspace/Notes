-RunicMagic (the class) needs a file path for the released language file path (en_US.lang) in the LoadConfigurations function.
-Save facing information as metadata for multitexture blocks and then use getIcon(side,meta) or its overloaded version.
-Faerie Ring Grass needs a better recipe.
-Fey blank runes needs to use fey stone. 
-Tools need implementing and real receipes.
-RunicMagicWorldGenerator needs to know what the faerie world id is (or switch it to name in the default switch).
-Balrog Mines need more epic generation in the Faerie world.
-We need to get our own biome generation going because trying to fight Minecraft's default ones is annoying.

-Have a Faerie World. You can get there by building an Faerie Ring or finding one that naturally spawns. Every mob that spawns in that world knows magic.
