Add a main config file that stores all game level scope configurations.
This should have a path to a config file for game controls.

Make sure that the system file allows us to define movement multipliers for flying, swimming, and such in the game system config file.
For example flying should probably be at half cost mostly for FE mode.

Make a way to edit pallets.
We should do this in it's own editor as it will be quite big.

Make an animation editor.
We should do this in it's own editor as it will be quite big.

Have a hexgrid option.
This is quite possible as all we need to do is add a boolean ishex to board and relevant drawing functions it uses.
From this we simply stagger the drawing location using math. Naturally this requires 100% transparency outside the hex, since images are always rectangles.
...May have to rethink erase function and paint and Overlaps algorithm.
Navigate cellwidth and cellheight to maps.

Have multiplayer, including a GM server which may require two forwarded ports.

Important for running the game
------------------------------
KeyListener[] listeners = board.getKeyListeners();
		
for(int i = 0;i < listeners.length;i++)
	addKeyListener(listeners[i]);
		
new DataDisplay().Display(board.GetDisplayedMap().GetItems(new Location(2,8,board.GetDisplayedMap().GetName())));
