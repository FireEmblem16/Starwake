The game is interesting enough as it is but it can be even better.

Since playing the original version to the death is illegal,
we can simulate motivation with money, or equivalent.

If you choose to play with bets, simply enable the option,
and the game will calculate the payouts to players.

If the payouts seem odd or wrong, get over it.
Omacron places his seal of approval that they were calculated properly.
