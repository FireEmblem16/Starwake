Create a world class.
-Has draw which is called as often as possible.
-Has update which is called as often as possible but uses a time stamp to determine the multiplier for velocity and such.
-Contains BoundedObjects and Objects of which the later should be updated and drawn first due to the nature of BoundedObjects.
-The BoundedObjects and Objects need a physics wrapper class that stores a,v,r,...
-Collisions should be done during update after updating.
-Collision math should be calculated...probably.
-An object need not be checked for collision if it is stationary. However a moving object may collide with it.
-Should have some way to load world data...somehow.
