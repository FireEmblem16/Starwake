Contains Java code for the Lollypop problem, aka the weighted activity problem. Input/Output and problem structure described in detail at the following link: http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~cs311/

Also contains a readme and some sample input data.

To compile the files run from a command line (or use a IDE like Eclipse)

javac Lollies.java Day.java

This will generate the class files and two Notes which are in regards to unchecked exceptions. Ignore them as they can not occur.

You can then run the class files by tying

java Lollies

while still in the directory containing the class (the same one unless manually changed). In/Out redirects of course work and if not used the program with input and output to the standard in/out buffers. stderr is not used.
